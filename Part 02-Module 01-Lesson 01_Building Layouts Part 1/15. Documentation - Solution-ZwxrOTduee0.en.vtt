00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.960
Okay, so I asked you to search for
textview android.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.310
Usually, when I do a search, I always
add the word android at the end of it,

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.210
so that it only shows
me android results.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.975
The first link is for TextView, and
it's on developer.android.com site so

00:00:13.975 --> 00:00:14.565
I'm going to click on it.

00:00:15.695 --> 00:00:18.875
I can ignore most of
the information on this page except

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:22.385
I do want to verify that
this is indeed for TextView.

00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:25.375
I can read the class overview but
the most important thing is down here,

00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:26.349
the XML attributes.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.170
So I can manually scroll the list,
but that will literally take forever.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.110
So, I'm going to use the fine
feature that I talked about earlier.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.280
The quiz question was about finding an
attribute that would change the text to

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.780
be bold or italic.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.145
So I'm going to search for
the word bold.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.220
Cool, so let's look at this description.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.690
It says Style (bold, italic,
bolditalic) for the text.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.842
That sounds pretty good, so
I can click on this attribute.

00:00:52.842 --> 00:00:57.230
For android:textStyle, it seems that
the different values are normal, bold,

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.780
or italic.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.270
Let's try it out.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.360
The documentation says that if I
add android:textStyle attribute,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.490
then I can set it to be bold,
italic, or normal.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.220
So let's try bold.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.750
Nice, and it bolds the font.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.030
And let's be adventurous and
try italic as well.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.080
Awesome, it italicizes the text.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.000
So this was an example of how
you can look at documentation

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.850
to find new attributes that
you can set on your TextView.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.940
In the future, when you're working
on something and you get stuck, or

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.070
you don't know how to do it,

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.900
remember they can always use
documentation as a resource.
