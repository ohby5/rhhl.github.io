My name is Kirill Grouchnikov, I've
been at Google for the last five years,

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.470
and I do client work,
UI work, on the Play store.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.550
&gt;&gt; Okay, awesome, and
what do you like about it?

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.760
&gt;&gt; Well, I always liked writing code and
seeing pixels light up on the screen.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.300
So this is the Play App,
Google Play App.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.420
Starting from top to bottom, we have
the search box, and we have these,

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.505
what we call quick links,
to go to various subsections of the app,

00:00:36.505 --> 00:00:38.150
and of the store.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.570
And then we have different content here,
so we have clusters of cards.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.080
We have this,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.650
we call a banner, that gets you
into some other place in the app.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.280
You can go into the details
page of a certain item,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:58.040
let's say Angry Birds Telepods, and
this is what we're showing here,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.890
kind of the mix of information
that the developer has provided.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.470
We have the video of the app.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.510
Then we have the short description
of the app's screenshots.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.600
Then we have the user provided content,
reviews and ratings of that app.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.470
A little bit more related content.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.559
And then here, a couple of links.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.100
And you can go also
from the details page.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.549
You can start the install process.

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.732
This is the permissions.

00:01:27.732 --> 00:01:29.340
And then you go and accept them.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.260
And it starts.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.087
So you can see over here,
it starts installing it.

00:01:36.908 --> 00:01:40.310
So the students have been learning
about text views, image views, buttons.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.370
Can you point out a couple
of those in apps?

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so back to the cards,
if we look at this Star Wars Rebels.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.660
So the card itself is
an extension of a view group.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.720
But it can be as simple as a extension
of our elegant layout, and

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.970
then we have this
thumbnail is an image view.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.760
Then we have this,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.870
Star Wars Rebel is a text view that
goes to a maximum of two lines.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.410
Rating bar is, well, rating bar.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.650
The free is text view, and
the overflow dots is an image view with

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.070
a source set to a certain PNG
that looks like three dots,

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.920
and then the same for
the quick links, so

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.530
it is a relative layout with
the image view on the left.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.690
And then the text view in single line
mode going to right of that image view,

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.330
and extending however much it needs.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.800
And it has its background

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.640
set to a certain drawable that has
a green background with rounded corners.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.730
So essentially, as you say, it boils
down to taking these very basic building

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.271
blocks, text views, image views,
sometimes rating bar,

00:02:57.271 --> 00:03:01.660
progress bar, spinner,
check box, radio button.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.320
And combining them based on what your
design shows on a particular screen.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.485
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's so cool because the
students are learning this in their very

00:03:10.485 --> 00:03:13.864
first lesson of Android and you're using
this every day in the Google Play app.

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:19.325
You mentioned working with a designer.

00:03:19.325 --> 00:03:22.105
So can you describe what
that process is like?

00:03:22.105 --> 00:03:24.595
&gt;&gt; So,
it starts from the product people, and

00:03:24.595 --> 00:03:27.445
then it goes into
discussions with design and

00:03:27.445 --> 00:03:33.525
engineering on what are the screen
surf we are talking about and

00:03:33.525 --> 00:03:37.670
how, hopefully, already at
that point of the design site,

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:44.180
we start thinking about how we'd adapt
to smaller screens, to larger screens.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.480
And after that,
we do these kind of iterations

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.070
on putting something on the screen, and
start validating the overall approach.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.050
Because sometimes you have a static
mark or maybe a motion mark

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.970
from after effects or
whatever tools the designers are using.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.690
And you see it on your desktop screen,

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.440
and then you put it on the phone and
it feels quite different.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.060
Because you have a smaller screen.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.500
Or because it's a tight interaction,
or maybe because you

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.560
are depending on all these great big
images, but the network is slow.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.720
And so, you start with this screen that
five seconds doesn't display anything.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.490
And so, hopefully throw out
this iteratic process, where.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.704
We put something on the screen,
not necessarily pixel perfect,

00:04:35.704 --> 00:04:39.152
then we can go back into the product
level discussions and see, okay,

00:04:39.152 --> 00:04:40.391
what do we need to tweak?

00:04:44.152 --> 00:04:47.593
&gt;&gt; So, for developers who don't
have a designer to work with,

00:04:47.593 --> 00:04:52.250
do you have suggestions on what they
can do to make their app look better?

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.860
&gt;&gt; I would suggest to
going to the website for

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.780
material design and get acquainted.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.590
Not necessarily with the finer
parts of motion arcs or

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.895
all those interpolators, but
focus on the bigger picture.

00:05:08.895 --> 00:05:14.460
So to have consistent grade
across the entire app,

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.820
what we call key lines or
what the design calls key lines.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.660
Vertical and horizontal, where elements
align to certain visual rhythm

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.180
and they don't feel just
randomly thrown onto the screen.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.300
And so you have your toolbar.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.880
You have,
maybe other parts of your Chrome,

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.470
like the navigation
elements on your screen.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.330
And then you have the content itself,
so it's great when it all aligns to

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.750
the same grid, and you have a little
bit of margins on the sides.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.230
And things are not too
close to each other.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.468
Then you have typography.

00:05:49.468 --> 00:05:56.910
Which is a great way to visually

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.915
convey the relative importance
of different things.

00:06:02.915 --> 00:06:08.045
So if you talk about something like
inbox, or Gmail, or an email app.

00:06:08.045 --> 00:06:10.995
So if everything has the same
typographical language.

00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:14.760
If everything is the same color,
the same size and the same style,

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.780
then it's not really easy to scan it.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.548
So maybe you would want
the RQ make the sender.

00:06:23.548 --> 00:06:27.690
A little bit bigger, like the sender
name, or maybe the title,

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:32.850
or the first few words of
the subject to be bold.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.630
And that would allow the user
to more quickly scan.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.860
It depends, once again, on your content.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.140
But I wouldn't recommend necessarily
going with too many styles,

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.210
or too many sizes.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:51.220
Three, four styles used
consistently across

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:57.100
multiple screens allow the user to kind
of get, even on a subconscious level.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.970
To get kind of a picture of how
to get things done in your app,

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.680
and necessarily fight to understand
where the information is that he or

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.410
she is looking for.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.820
And the last thing, colors.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.780
Use a little bit of,
especially with material.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:24.140
It kind of leans toward using big
splashes of saturated colors,

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.490
which looks great, especially if it goes
into the status bar on Lollipop devices.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:34.620
Identify what we call the accent
colors and primary colors.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.320
Identify a couple of colors.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:41.350
And use them to, kind of, you know,
to style the chrome of your app,

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:46.410
so like status bar, action bar, maybe
a little bit in the navigation drawer.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:50.540
And use and highlight so X sends for
the floating action button or

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.962
maybe to draw attention to
a certain,very important element,

00:07:54.962 --> 00:07:57.240
what you consider a very
important element.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:02.620
And I think these three
go along way towards

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:08.980
emphasizing a little bit more
the visual style of the app.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.140
And of course,

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:15.200
if you have an opportunity to team up
with a designer, that's always great.
