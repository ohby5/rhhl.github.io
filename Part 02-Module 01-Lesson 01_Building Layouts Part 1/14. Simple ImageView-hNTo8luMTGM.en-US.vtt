00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.460
We played around a little
bit with TextView.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.914
And the other view we want to learn
about now to make our birthday

00:00:05.914 --> 00:00:07.248
card is the ImageView.

00:00:07.248 --> 00:00:09.910
Now here's the XML for ImageView.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.140
Let's look at the lines one at a time.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.600
The XML element starts with
an open angle bracket, ding.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.208
And then the name of the view [SOUND]
and then the list of attributes,

00:00:20.208 --> 00:00:20.795
[SOUND] Piu.

00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:24.124
Then it's followed by a forward slash,
and then a closing angle bracket.

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:25.832
[SOUND] Boom.

00:00:25.832 --> 00:00:30.540
When we wrote the XML for TextView,
it displayed text on the screen.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.710
So now, when we write ImageView here,
it displays an image on the screen.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.963
The first attribute is something
we haven't seen before.

00:00:36.963 --> 00:00:41.010
It says android:src
equals at drawable/cake.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.330
This is saying that the source for this
image should be found in this file here.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.580
The file name is called cake.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.225
We use the at symbol to
say that we're referencing

00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:56.405
a resource in the Android app, and
drawable is the resource type.

00:00:56.405 --> 00:01:00.205
A drawable is like a graphic that
will be shown on screen in Android.

00:01:00.205 --> 00:01:02.505
And again, cake is the file image name.

00:01:02.505 --> 00:01:04.670
We don't include the file extension.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.890
You don't need to say if it's a JPEG or
PNG image.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.550
Just say the file name.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.050
If you're wondering where this image
came from, well we handle this a little

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.270
bit differently in the XML Visualizer
compared to the app.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.190
But basically, we loaded in
a bunch of images beforehand so

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.510
that you can use them to
practice in XML Visualizer.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.990
When you build your app in
Android Studio you're going to have to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.380
add images manually into your app,
into the drawable folder.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.740
Now, if I try to reference
an image that doesn't exist, for

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.150
example, the toys image does not exist.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.105
Then there will be an error
because toys is not a valid image.

00:01:39.105 --> 00:01:42.325
So make sure that you only reference
images that are available.

00:01:42.325 --> 00:01:44.375
So let's change it back by hitting undo.

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:47.495
Now we have the width and height,
which are set to be wrapped content.

00:01:47.495 --> 00:01:52.085
So that the image view is only as
big as the cake image inside of it.

00:01:52.085 --> 00:01:55.165
Lastly, we have this attribute
called Android:scaledType and

00:01:55.165 --> 00:01:57.265
it's set to be center.

00:01:57.265 --> 00:02:00.125
Scale type tells the device
how to scale up or

00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:04.320
scale down,
based on the bound of the ImageView.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.400
Let's see what that looks like.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.280
Now you can see the cake image
showing up on the device.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.980
The cake image is actually pretty large,
and it's larger than the screen size.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.640
So when we say scaleType,

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.420
it doesn't change the size of the image,
it just centers it.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.330
So we see that the cake image
is actually really big,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.040
but this is the center
of the cake image.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.750
We can set other values for
scaleType, such as centerCrop.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.460
This scales down the image to fit
the height and width of the view.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.680
In this case, we're constrained
by the sides of the screen.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.670
We also maintain the aspect
ratio of the original image so

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.680
it doesn't get distorted.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.330
Once we scale it down,
we also center the image, and

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.805
then crop it so
that it fits this ViewSize.

00:02:47.805 --> 00:02:51.355
When displaying photographs,
I like to use center crop.

00:02:51.355 --> 00:02:55.955
This is because it's typically okay to
crop off the edges of the photograph

00:02:55.955 --> 00:02:58.715
in order to achieve
this edge to edge look.

00:02:58.715 --> 00:03:01.285
When images go edge to edge
without any white border or

00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:05.475
anything, this is what we
call a full bleed image.

00:03:05.475 --> 00:03:08.349
We use a lot of full bleed images
in the material design guide.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.740
Here are some examples.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.060
You see how the images go
edge to edge here, and

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.580
it give it a nice immersive feel.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.750
Okay, now it is time for you to try.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.990
Specifically, we would love for
you to be able to change the height and

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.240
width of the image view
to be a fixed dp value.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.370
Try something like 100dp.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.630
Then change the scale type between
center and center crop, and

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.350
you can also adjust the height and
width of the image accordingly.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.120
For example, what happens if you change
the height and width of the image view

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.520
to be greater than the sides of
the device, or what happens if you set

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.080
the height and width to be something
smaller than the size of the device?

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.770
&gt;&gt; In those cases you may see
different behavior for center and

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.490
center crop
&gt;&gt; Also, try to change the image to

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.610
something else by checking
the Available Images link.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.880
We've included a small
version of the cake image,

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.610
as well as a larger version, so that
you can try the different scale types.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.180
We also included an Android icon.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.830
