00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
Tell us about a time when you were learning something new and you had to struggle.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.330
Okay, Catherine, if you're going to ask

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.135
our students to share their vulnerable stories on the internet,

00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:10.815
we have to lead by example.

00:00:10.815 --> 00:00:13.080
Okay, fair enough. You go first.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.165
Okay. Well, I've been learning to play the piano for about eight months.

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:18.810
Okay.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.750
And the toughest bits for me have been getting

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.010
one hand right and then getting

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.195
the right hand right and then putting those two things together,

00:00:26.195 --> 00:00:30.135
but when it comes out, it's just so beautiful, it's like, ta-da-da-da.

00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:31.605
Wow, that sounds really good.

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:34.170
I've been playing for my friends, it's really fun.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.970
Wait, you haven't played for me.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.150
Oh, we'll see, if we stay friends till the end of this course, I can.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.735
Okay, then.

00:00:39.735 --> 00:00:40.365
Your turn.

00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:43.940
All right. I've struggled with learning Chinese my whole life.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.740
Wait, you speak Chinese?

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.660
Yeah. Ni hao?

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.340
Wo jiao Li Xiao Shen.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.100
It's not a big deal.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.460
So, I think the hardest part of learning Chinese has been trying to learn

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.500
all the vocab words and trying to put them

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.380
together in complete sentences without tripping up.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.005
This story of yours is reminding me that

00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:07.965
learning how to make an Android app is like learning a new language.

00:01:07.965 --> 00:01:08.970
Okay, I can see that.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.430
So, you're learning a new vocabulary and you're putting those things

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.670
together and programming sentences and creating an app.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.830
Okay. Well, those are our stories.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.015
Now, I want our students to share their vulnerable stories.

00:01:20.015 --> 00:01:23.800
Tell us about a time when you learned something new and it was a struggle.
