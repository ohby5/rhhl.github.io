00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
This is what the numbers activity file should look like,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.960
so down here we deleted the for loop and added

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.245
these three lines of code to create an adapter and then set it on the ListView.

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:16.510
Now, we also modified activity numbers XML layout file,

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:24.065
so in here notice that we used a ListView and it has an ID list.

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:26.170
By the way an Android Studio if you show

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.590
the preview window for the activity numbers layout file,

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.910
you'll notice that the device preview shows a list of items and sub-items.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.430
So, since the ListView needs to be populated with

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.760
lists items using Java code and not XML.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.550
This is just a preview of what it could look like,

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.300
but when you check your device you won't see these exact items.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.920
Alright, so let's run the app on a device now and this is what it should look like,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.045
displaying list of numbers one through 10.

00:00:52.045 --> 00:00:53.490
We also see a divider between

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.060
each list item and this divider comes built-in with ListView,

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.490
but you can customize it or even hide it completely by modifying ListView XML attributes.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.700
For our use case we're going to leave the dividers as is.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.850
Well now that we have a ListView and adapter in our app,

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.200
let's go ahead and figure out what on earth they're actually doing.
