00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.420
When we first open up the Miwok app,
we see this list of categories.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.390
Now, there's only a couple of categories
here, and this list is pretty fixed.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.330
So in this case,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.670
we can stick with using a vertical
linear layout with four text views.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.670
Now on the other hand,
when I tap into the Numbers activity,

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.230
these list items could
get more complicated.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.500
We could potentially add a lot more
vocabulary words to this list.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.120
For example, deciding to display
the numbers 1 through 1,000.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.480
So this list is a good use case for
viewer cycling.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.940
So I'm going to show you
how to modify our code so

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.630
that we can use the list view and
array adapter.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.680
Now, I know there's a lot of concepts
going on right now but it's okay.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.670
We'll take it one step at a time.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.380
First, I'd like you to get the code
working and running on your phone.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.356
And then I want you to make some
observations on how you think it's all

00:00:47.356 --> 00:00:48.241
working together.

00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:49.200
And then afterwards,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.490
we'll walk through together what's
exactly happening behind the scenes.
