00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.260
So I'd like you to apply what
you just learned about arraylist

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.270
to modify the numbers activity.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.848
To represent the list of vocabulary
words as an arraylist of strings,

00:00:08.848 --> 00:00:11.790
rather than an array of strings.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.840
Now, if you are creating this app
in a professional environment,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.920
either arraylist or
an array would be valid.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.610
On the other hand,
if our app connected to the Internet and

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.340
will continue to grow
with new words over time.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.840
Then a list would probably
be more appropriate, so

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.650
even though our app won't get
new words from the internet.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.645
Within the context of this course,
I'd still prefer to use an array list.

00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:36.050
Because it's easier to add additional
words without worrying about needing to

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.040
change the size of the array.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.940
So, for the first part of this exercise,
I'd like you to modify the app, so

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.810
we store the words in an array list,
instead of an array.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.710
Now, the words should stay the same.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.370
It should be the numbers one
through ten spelled out, and

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.900
be sure to update the log messages.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.030
So we print out each element of the
array list, instead of from the array.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.850
And remember, you can always reference
this table that summarizes how the code

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.580
is different between
an array an array list.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.750
And when you run the latest version
of the code on your device,

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.340
there shouldn't be any changes
in the appearance of the app.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.700
And rememberm you can check the logs
to verify that the list was

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.780
created properly.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.540
And go ahead and
check these boxes when you're done.
