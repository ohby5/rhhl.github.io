00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.780
Now that you have come more
familiar with how to write code for

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.170
arrays in Java, you're going to modify
the Miwok app to store a list of words.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.150
So the numbers category, I know that we
have English words and Miwok words for

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.050
the numbers one through ten.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.180
So let's just focus on
the English words for now.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.610
How can we store this
information in our app?

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.690
Should we use separate variables for
each individual number or

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.210
a single array variable?

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.040
And what data type
should the variables be?

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.250
I'd like you to write your
answer in blank here.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.850
Now for the second question,
what should the size of the array be?

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.840
Go ahead and write your response here.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.490
Once you've got a good idea in
your head of how to do this,

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.520
make the code changes by modifying
the NumbersActivity.java file.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.350
So go ahead and add your code here at
the end of the onCreate method but

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.070
before the closing brace.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.060
So by adding this code here,
when the activity is created, and

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.160
you will see the layout to be defined
in the activity_numbers file.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.057
Then will create the list of words.

00:00:55.057 --> 00:00:57.850
So after you add the code,
make sure the App Store works and

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.050
there's no errors in Android Studio.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.930
You won't see anything different show
up in the NumbersActivity just yet, but

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.440
we're making progress toward seeing
the list of numbers eventually

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.110
appear in the screen.
