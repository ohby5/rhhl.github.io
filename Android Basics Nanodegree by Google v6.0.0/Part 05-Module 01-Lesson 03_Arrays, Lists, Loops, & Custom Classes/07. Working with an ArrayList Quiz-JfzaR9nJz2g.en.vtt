00:00:00.592 --> 00:00:04.090
Welcome back, and let's take a look
at the correct code statements

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.880
needed to implement
each of these comments.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.460
So for this first comment here, asking
us to create a new ArrayList object

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.780
called restaurantsToTry, and
containing a list of strings.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.810
The code for that looks like this.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.560
So we have ArrayList of type String,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.540
the object name restaurantsToTry
= new ArrayList of type String.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.700
And note that when
instantiating an ArrayList,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.470
we don't need to input
any parameters here.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.540
Now for this second comment,
asking us to add a restaurant called

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.240
Morning Cafe to the ArrayList,
the code looks like this.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.700
So we have restaurantsToTry.add and it's
taking in Morning Cafe as its input.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.790
So here's what that looks like visually.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.780
So using our .add method,

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.788
we've added Morning Cafe at the zeroth
index of our restaurantsToTry ArrayList.

00:00:51.788 --> 00:00:53.608
So now onto the third comment,

00:00:53.608 --> 00:00:56.763
asking us to add another
restaurant called BBQ Time.

00:00:56.763 --> 00:00:58.043
So the code looks really similar.

00:00:58.043 --> 00:01:00.098
We have restaurantsToTry.add, and

00:01:00.098 --> 00:01:03.390
this time, it's taking in
BBQ Time as its input parameter.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.870
So here's the code again, and this time,

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.830
we're adding in BBQ Time as
the first index of this ArrayList.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.930
So now onto our fourth comment.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.680
So the user has just tried
our Morning Cafe restaurant.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.850
So we want to go ahead and
remove it from our ArrayList.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.043
So all we need to do is use
the restaurantsToTry.remove method, and

00:01:22.043 --> 00:01:25.330
then take in Morning Cafe
as its parameter.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.510
So for our fourth comment, the user has
just tried our Morning Cafe restaurant,

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.020
and so we just want to remove it
from the restaurant's ArrayList now.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.470
So the code for that looks like this,
restaurantsToTry.remove, and

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.550
it takes in Morning Cafe
as its input parameter.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.580
So visually, using the .remove method,
we remove Morning Cafe and that shrinks

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.660
the size of the array and moves BBQ Time
up to the zeroth index of the ArrayList.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.680
So onto our last comment.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.627
So we want to get
the length of the list and

00:01:55.627 --> 00:01:58.525
then store it in an integer
called numberOfRestaurants.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.800
So the code for that looks like this.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.900
We have int numberOfRestaurants
= restaurantsToTry.size.

00:02:08.994 --> 00:02:13.450
Remember for ArrayList, when we use
the method size, it doesn't take in any

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.210
input parameters and it retrieves for
us the number of elements in the list.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.150
So in our case right now,
the size of the ArrayList is just one.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.650
