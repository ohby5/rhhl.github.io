00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
To make the words appear in the other activities,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.100
we can follow the first hint which was to copy and paste

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.935
the code the way we already have in the numbers activity.

00:00:07.935 --> 00:00:11.700
So let's copy all this code here from the numbers activity.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.465
And then first, we'll paste it into the colors activity.

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:18.090
Before I paste this block of code in,

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.750
the colors activity was using the activity_colors.xml file as a content view.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.355
So we could change the colors activity to refer to this layout file again.

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:32.460
However, we would also need to change the layout file to have

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.345
a list_view XML layout instead of a relative layout.

00:00:36.345 --> 00:00:38.760
In the quiz, we give you hint number two,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.680
which is all the activities can use

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.235
the same layout file which has a list item element in it.

00:00:44.235 --> 00:00:49.140
Since activity_numbers.xml already has a correct layout,

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.955
let's just go ahead and use that.

00:00:50.955 --> 00:00:53.475
Delete this tools:context attribute,

00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:56.775
which says which file the layout should be used in,

00:00:56.775 --> 00:01:00.270
because now, this layout will be used for four different activities.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.230
Next, we'll want to rename this file so that it's not number specific.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.765
So to do that, we'll right-click,

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:10.605
head to refactor, and then rename.

00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:15.960
So how about something like word_list.xml.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.490
So refactoring here we'll update all locations in the code

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.330
that refer to the old name and update it with the new name now.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.120
Back in the numbers activity,

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.215
we referred to the activity_numbers layout.

00:01:28.215 --> 00:01:30.990
But notice here, it now refers to the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.540
words_list.xml file which is the new name for the same file.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.540
And then when we move over to the colors activity,

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.670
we can set the content view to also be

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.375
the words list excel file which contains a list item view.

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:46.520
So then in the colors activity,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.470
we can set the content view to also be the

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.425
word_list.xml file which contains a ListView element.

00:01:52.425 --> 00:01:54.840
All right, so let's make sure all the code in

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.850
the colors activity's correctly referring to

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.245
the colors category and we don't have anything left over that still refers to numbers.

00:02:01.245 --> 00:02:04.485
So the most apparent one here is the English and miwok translations.

00:02:04.485 --> 00:02:08.040
Let's update that to reflect the color words.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.520
So the remaining code in onCreate method looks correct

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.790
so we created a word adapter from this list of word colors.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.560
Then we find the ListView with the view ID list in the words_list.xml layout.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.540
And lastly, we set the adapter onto this ListView.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.695
So now, there's no errors in our code,

00:02:25.695 --> 00:02:27.500
so let's run the app on a device.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.870
So when the app launches and I click on the colors category,

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.920
we see the list of color words. Nice, it's working.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.770
So the miwok color's on top and the English word is below it.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.560
Now, we will repeat the same thing with family activity.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.575
I copied over the file from the colors activity and

00:02:43.575 --> 00:02:46.890
updated the list of family words from the provided dictionary document.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.250
And when I run the app on my device, it looks like this.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.800
Now, excellent job. All the categories are

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.800
properly displaying the miwok and English translations for each word.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.225
Now, there's one last clean up step we could do that would be nice to fix our code.

00:03:00.225 --> 00:03:02.640
Since we're just using a single layout file,

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.155
our wordless XML file,

00:03:05.155 --> 00:03:06.924
for all four activities,

00:03:06.924 --> 00:03:09.100
we can delete the unused layout files.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.870
I'm going to go ahead and delete the layout files for the colors, family, and phrases.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.810
Whenever you delete files, you should test the app one more time to make sure it's

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.900
still working and you didn't delete anything you actually might need.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.950
So after running the app on my device,

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.710
it looks like it's still working.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.360
So take a step back and congratulate yourself.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.770
You just finished the coding test in lesson two.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.880
That's a really big milestone.
