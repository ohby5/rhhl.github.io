00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.190
So if you follow the instructions in the quiz,

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.275
you would've created the Word class.

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:08.700
And Android Studio helped us out by auto generating some code for us already. All right.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.050
So first in our Word class,

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.565
we declare as publicly accessible.

00:00:12.565 --> 00:00:16.855
That way other classes like the numbers activity would be able to access and use it.

00:00:16.855 --> 00:00:19.870
Also here, I've added the Java doc comment already above

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.180
the class declaration to explain how

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.845
the Word class is meant to represent a vocabulary word.

00:00:24.845 --> 00:00:26.380
So notice that it contains

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.120
it English default translation and a Miwok translation for each word.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.870
Hence we'll need two fields for the state of the word object.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.075
mDefaultTranslation,

00:00:37.075 --> 00:00:40.410
which is the word in a language that the users are already familiar with.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.270
So for example, English, and secondly,

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.345
mMiwokTranslation, which is a word in the Miwok language.

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:50.700
So both of these here notice are private because

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.610
we only need them to be accessible from inside the class.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.180
So by convention since they are private member variables of the class,

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.940
we add a lowercase "m" to indicate that.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.225
And the "m" is added to the start of each variable name.

00:01:03.225 --> 00:01:08.400
So next we need to create the constructor which takes in two string parameters.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.030
The defaultTranslation and miwokTranslation.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.195
And then set these values for our two fields.

00:01:15.195 --> 00:01:17.820
So in order to create a new word object,

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.360
the caller has to parse in these two required inputs.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.870
Remember that the constructor has to look like a method declaration.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.690
But the name has to match the class name exactly,

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.925
which in this case is Word.

00:01:29.925 --> 00:01:33.105
And remember that it has no return type.

00:01:33.105 --> 00:01:36.730
So lastly, we'll add two methods which will be marked as public

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.260
so the classes outside of the Word class can access these methods.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.010
So first, is the getDefaultTranslation method,

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.900
which will return the default translation of the word whose return type is string.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.240
So we won't accept any parameters because its sole purpose is just to return information.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.450
Our second method is getMiwokTranslation,

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.775
and we'll follow a similar format.

00:01:59.775 --> 00:02:02.850
So notice that it returns the Miwok translation of a word,

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.620
which is a string data type.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.890
Now remember to add comments above each method help people who are

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.565
reading your code to better understand what to expect from each method.

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:14.460
So we could have added two setter methods to

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.425
allow the two strings to be changed by an outside caller.

00:02:17.425 --> 00:02:19.425
However, for the purpose of this app,

00:02:19.425 --> 00:02:21.015
once we create the Word object,

00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:23.970
we don't expect the English or Miwok words to change.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.110
Hence, we won't provide setter methods to modify the state of the Word object.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.610
So when you create a class,

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.735
it's entirely up to you to decide what methods you want to expose to the outside classes.

00:02:33.735 --> 00:02:35.595
All right. So there we have it.

00:02:35.595 --> 00:02:39.365
Here is the Word class defined in its entirety with the declaration,

00:02:39.365 --> 00:02:43.050
state, constructor and methods.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.700
Now, great work on defining your first custom class.
