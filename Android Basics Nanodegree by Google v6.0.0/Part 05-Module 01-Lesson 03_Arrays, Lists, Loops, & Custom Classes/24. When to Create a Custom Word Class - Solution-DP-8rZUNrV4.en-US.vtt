00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.480
So let's take a look at how he
created the custom Word class.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.560
A Word object should represent
a single vocabulary word

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.300
that we want the user to learn.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.200
It should contain both the English and
Miwok translations for the same word.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.379
Now each of these translations can
be stored as a string variable in

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.420
the class.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.190
So to summarize the answer to the
question what state should a Word object

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.000
contain and
what is the data type of each variable?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Well the Word object should contain two
string variables, one for the English

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.410
translation of the word, and one for
the Miwok translation of the same word.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.730
Now this is what it
looks like in a diagram.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.960
For the word object,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.420
we have an English translation and
a Miwok text translation.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.020
Since we know that this course
is being utilized by students

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.160
who don't necessarily speak
English as a primary language.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.490
We don't want to call
the variable English translation.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.650
So instead we chose
the term defaultTranslation

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.310
to represent the translation
that is your primary language.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.120
So to answer the question,
what methods should we have?

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.110
We should have a method to get
the English translation and

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.640
a method to get the Miwok translation.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.050
And here's what that
looks like visually.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.590
So for the methods,
this might have been a tricky one.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.260
Our Word class is the container
that holds two variables.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.950
There's no complex logic to
abstract away in the Word class.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.840
We're just going to expose two methods
in which some outside color can retrieve

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.390
the English and Miwok translations.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.760
And again, instead of calling
the methods getEnglishTranslation,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.180
we decided here to use
getDefaultTranslation.
