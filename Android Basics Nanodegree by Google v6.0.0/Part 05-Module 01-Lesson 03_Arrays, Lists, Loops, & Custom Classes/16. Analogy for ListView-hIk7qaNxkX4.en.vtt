00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
Now, in Android. There are different types of

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.850
views that can recycle views besides the ListView.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.105
So this includes GridView or RecyclerView.

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:10.845
But now in the next few slides,

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:15.495
I'm going to point out to you some cases where the developer should be reusing views,

00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:18.810
and other example cases where they didn't need to worry

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.770
about reusing views because maybe there were just a small number of views anyway.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.710
So in the Twitter app, there are millions of tweets.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.075
You can keep scrolling but chances are you won't be scrolling for hours on straight.

00:00:30.075 --> 00:00:32.400
So that's why it's a smart decision to just create

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.430
the views on demand when the user scrolls to them,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.898
which means we can recycle our views.

00:00:37.898 --> 00:00:41.745
The Google Fit app gives users insight into their daily fitness.

00:00:41.745 --> 00:00:46.620
A user can track information about their daily activity such as an afternoon time run.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.367
And the app presents a summary page listing the active time,

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:53.235
total time, estimated distance,

00:00:53.235 --> 00:00:57.450
steps, and calories for that specific activity.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.780
Now, because there's a fixed number of metrics that the app displays,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.625
there is no need to recycle views.

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:05.715
This portion of the app can just use a vertical LinearLayout.

00:01:05.715 --> 00:01:07.785
Now for those interested in Finance,

00:01:07.785 --> 00:01:11.460
the Stocks real time stock quotes app allows users to

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.765
track and add stocks that they're interested in into their portfolio.

00:01:15.765 --> 00:01:19.920
And it's quite common for users to have a lot of companies that they're interested in,

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.810
so the list could get really long.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.930
The app could efficiently display all this information about

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.820
these companies by recycling views as the user is scrolling through the list.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.725
Now for this exercise,

00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:34.440
I'd like you to take some time to explore either apps on

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.970
your device or maybe other popular Android apps and find two examples.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.120
So the first example is one where using

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.465
a vertical LinearLayout for all the list items is a good idea.

00:01:45.465 --> 00:01:47.120
And for the second example,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.300
to find an app that should recycle views using something like a ListView.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.370
And then, I'd like you to share your answers in

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.080
the discussion forums to get some conversation started with other students.
