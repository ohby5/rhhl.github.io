00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.170
Now, handling audio focus in
our app is going to be a pretty

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.750
significant code change.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.010
So before you go off on your own,
let's walk through the major decisions

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.570
you'll need to make when
using the Audio Manager API.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.480
So remember, API just refers to the
classes and methods that are offered by

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.120
the Android framework that
you as a developer can use.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.070
Now let's start by requesting
audio focus from the AudioManager.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.830
In order to begin playing
the audio on the app.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.840
In the last quiz, we found that we need
to call the requestAudioFocus method and

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.049
it requires three inputs,
onAudioFocusChangeListener object,

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:38.410
a streamType and a durationHint.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.443
So these last two inputs here,
the streamType and

00:00:42.443 --> 00:00:44.303
the durationHint are integers.

00:00:44.303 --> 00:00:48.300
Now when we call this method
requestAudioFocus what should we pass in

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.550
as a stream type which will
be our second parameter and

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.560
this refers to the type of
audio they we're playing?

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.540
So is this a song or ring tone?

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.130
And for the second question,
which we pass in as the durationHint?

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.550
So the third parameter.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.780
And this refers to how long
we need audio focus for.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.350
So do we need it for a short period
time or a long period of time?

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.050
So as a hint, both of these answer
choices should be integers, and

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.990
more specifically they should be integer
constants that have already been defined

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.280
in the AudioManager class.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.110
So in the reference documentation for
the AudioManager class, if we scroll

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.100
down to this public constant section and
then go down a little bit further.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.030
So these are all the possible
stream types that you can

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.280
pass into a requestAudioFocus method.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.686
And you can refer to them
as audiomanager.stream or

00:01:34.686 --> 00:01:38.650
audiomanager.stream.DTMF and so on and

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.730
so on and the descriptions for
each stream type is on the right column.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.400
So let's click into the stream along
constant to get some more details.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.680
Now remember a constant is a fixed
value the never changes, and

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.090
by convention we name the variable
in all capital letters.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.620
So it's often used to
communicate a certain state.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.830
So this case are stream alone
has a value of four and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.490
that will never change.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.420
So when we pass in this constant
value to the AudioManager,

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.690
it knows that we mean this
particular stream type.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.610
All right so this takes care of it for
our stream types.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.100
What about our durationHint?

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.110
Let's navigate over here to
requestAudioFocus method and

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.295
notice here the different
valid options for

00:02:17.295 --> 00:02:20.140
durationHint are listed in
the method description.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.764
So we have different ones such
as audioFocus_Gain_Transient,

00:02:22.764 --> 00:02:25.030
audioFocus_Gain_Transient_May_Duck and

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.370
then a couple other ones and
each of these have explanations

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.590
to help you choose which one is
the appropriate one to pick.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.970
So feel free to search online for

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.850
tutorials if you need help
answering these two questions.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.750
And I'd like you to fill out your
answers here and then continue on.
