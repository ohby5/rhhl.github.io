All right so now we're familiar with
the basics of media player in Android.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.190
We need to take what we learned
with the music player app and

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.910
apply it to our Miwok App.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.140
But, first, we need to figure out where
we should put the media player code

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.550
within our Miwok App.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.050
Now in the app demo, I showed you
that when we click on a list item,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.450
we should play the audio
pronunciation for the selected word.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.932
So, how do we do this
programatically in the Java code?

00:00:23.932 --> 00:00:27.970
Well, one way to do it is to add
a click listener on to each list item.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.950
So, remember from lesson one,
we defined a click listener for

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.550
each category view and then we
implemented the OnClickListener for

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.020
the numbers category, the family
category and all the other categories.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.850
With that logic,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.360
we could create a different
OnClickListener for each list item.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.520
But if we were to have, say,
a thousand words in our list,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.175
that would be a lot of
OnClickListener objects.

00:00:48.175 --> 00:00:50.520
Well, of course, the android team
thought that this would be a common

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.980
request, handling clicks on
list items in the list view.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.670
So they came up with the way for us as
developers to easily add this behavior.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.735
To help us figure out how to do this,
let's go through this exercise.

00:01:01.735 --> 00:01:05.019
I'd like you to research how we
can define what should happen

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.460
when a list item gets clicked on and,
more specifically, what method should we

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.680
call on the ListView, as well as
what are the inputs to that method?

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.720
And I'd like you to specify
the data type for each input.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.820
Go ahead and write your answers here.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.250
Note that they'll be no code
changes required in this exercise.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.620
You'll be modifying the app
in the next exercise.
