00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.830
All right, so after that research,

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.620
we now know how to set a click listener
onto a list item in the list view.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and going back to our
boxes we have this ListView object

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.540
which contains our list item views.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.600
And we can call
the setOnItemClickListener method and

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.106
pass in a listener object.

00:00:15.106 --> 00:00:19.970
&gt;&gt; And this on item ClickListener object
has a method called onItemClick, and

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.770
it can contain any
instructions that we want.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.350
So things like popping up a toast
message, or even play an audio file.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.020
&gt;&gt; Okay.
That makes sense.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.870
And we're going to be hand-holding
the student less, right?

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.370
&gt;&gt; But I like holding hands.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.210
&gt;&gt; Jessica.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.860
&gt;&gt; All right, it's okay, it's okay.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.010
Even though this next coding
exercise has multiple steps,

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.560
I'm confident the student can handle it.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.640
&gt;&gt; See, that's the spirit.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.080
&gt;&gt; So for this next task,
I want you to modify the app so

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.510
that clicking on a list
item plays an audio file.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.910
&gt;&gt; You can do it.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.120
&gt;&gt; Earlier we decided we would start off
by making it work for a single audio

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.390
file and then switch over to
the correct audio files for each word.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.270
So I want to provide you with one audio
file for the number word one, lutti.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.790
So check the notes below the quiz
to download that MP3 file and

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.650
only be modifying the numbers
activity right now.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.480
So this is what you app should
look like when you're done.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.438
Clicking on any list item should
play the same word, lutti.

00:01:10.438 --> 00:01:12.410
&gt;&gt; Lutti.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.200
&gt;&gt; When you're done with this task,
go ahead and check this check box.
