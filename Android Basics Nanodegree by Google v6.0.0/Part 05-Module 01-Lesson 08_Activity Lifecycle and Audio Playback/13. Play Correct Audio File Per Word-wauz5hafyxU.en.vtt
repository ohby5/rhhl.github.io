00:00:00.702 --> 00:00:04.510
I'm going to be tackling this coding
task by following these four steps.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.410
So first, we'll need to update
the word class to store the audio

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.050
information for each word.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.990
After that, we will need to update the
way that the list of words are created.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.850
Following, we'll need to
update the OnItemClickListener

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.280
to play the correct sound file
when an item is clicked on.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.800
And then lastly, for now I'm going
to focus on the numbers activity but

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.520
then we're going to repeat the process
for all our other categories.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.740
Now here in our world class, I want to
start by adding an integer variable

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.990
that we can use to store
an Audio Resource ID.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.370
Now, this will just be
the resource ID that we reference,

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.550
where the actual audio
file can be found.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.375
And notice here,
that I've called it mAudioResourceId.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:45.797
Then, I want to modify the word
constructors to accept another input,

00:00:45.797 --> 00:00:48.068
in order to set the audio field.

00:00:48.068 --> 00:00:50.880
So I'm going to add it to both
constructors because all words will have

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.690
to have an audio file, regardless of
whether they have an image or not.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.070
Then, I'm going to set the member
variable mAudioResourceId

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.510
to be equal to the audio
parameter that was passed in.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.780
Now every time you
modify the constructor,

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.190
remember to update the java.comment.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.150
That way, any other developers
who are calling the constructor

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.090
knows what inputs to pass in.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.630
Since we declared the audio
variable to be private

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.960
we should create a public getter method.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.070
Just like we created public methods for
other classes in order to access

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.180
the English and Miwok strings,
as well as the Image Resource ID.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.030
So, I want to make a public method here,
the returns an Integer Resource ID and

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.212
I'm going to name the method
getAudioResourceId.

00:01:30.212 --> 00:01:33.490
There are going to be no
input requirements and

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.890
the method will just return
the private audio variable.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.730
Also, since it's a public method,
I'm going to add a comment to

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.512
the method just to clarify
what the purpose of it is.

00:01:42.512 --> 00:01:45.530
All right, so those were all the changes
we need to make the word class.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.910
So, now we have a new private
audio variable and it's set

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.412
via the two constructors, and we have
a public method to access that variable.

00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:55.460
All right,so that finished
off our first step, and

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.650
since we modified the word
class constructors,

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.510
we'll need to modify the places
that we use those constructors.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.740
So, for example in the NumbersActivity,
the FamilyActivity, and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.130
all the other activities.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.250
So there we need to change how
the word objects are created.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.180
Now in the numbers activity,
we created an array list of words and

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.710
each word was created
with three arguments.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.830
So first, the English word,
the Miwok word, and then the image.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.530
Now we need to add a fourth argument
which will be the resource ID

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.020
of the audio file that
goes along with the word.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.949
So for the number 1,
I'm going to add R.raw.number_1.

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:33.973
And as you can see here, Android Studio
is smart enough to automatically suggest

00:02:33.973 --> 00:02:36.813
the files that have been added
to the Raw folder already,

00:02:36.813 --> 00:02:39.440
just in case I forget what
the resources were named.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.059
Now for the number 2,
I'm going to add R.raw.number_2.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.560
So I'm going to copy and
paste and make modifications for

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.780
the rest of the ten numbers.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.610
And this is what the code should
look like when all the words have

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.520
an Audio Resource ID.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.370
So the rest of the code in the numbers
activity can continue using the words

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.350
array list as before.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.780
Now, I want to make the updates
to the other categories so

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.880
that they use the right constructor.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.850
I when I open up a PhrasesActivity,
I see that there are errors showing up.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.235
And this is because that there
are no valid word constructors for

00:03:12.235 --> 00:03:13.619
just two inputs anymore.

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:16.490
So let's make some changes
to get rid these errors.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.140
So here's what the words list
should look like when each word

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.450
is using the correct
three input constructor.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.550
Now remember, if the line of
code exceeds a 100 columns,

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.995
we should wrap the text to the next
line and then indent by 8 spaces.

00:03:29.995 --> 00:03:32.810
Also, note here that
the ArrayList is now final.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.000
So I want to make similar changes to our
FamilyActivity and our ColorsActivity.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.383
And here's what the finished code
looks like for the FamilyActivity and

00:03:41.383 --> 00:03:42.732
the ColorsActivity.

00:03:42.732 --> 00:03:45.098
All right, so
now the word class has been updated,

00:03:45.098 --> 00:03:47.980
as well as the places that we
call the word class constructor.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.338
Next, we're going to update
the OnItemClickListener so

00:03:50.338 --> 00:03:52.758
that it plays the correct audio file.

00:03:52.758 --> 00:03:55.380
In the NumberActivity,
I'm going to modify the code for

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.260
when a list item gets clicked on.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.580
So right now, we always play
the same number_one MP3 file.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.050
Let's insert some code above it.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.950
But first we need to figure out
which word is getting clicked on and

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.130
then store that in a variable.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.190
So from the onItemClick
method position parameter,

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.720
I can check the words array list to
get the word that was clicked on.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.950
So, to do that,
I can just call words.get and

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.060
pass in the position variable.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.378
So, this method will return a single
word variable, I can go ahead and

00:04:24.378 --> 00:04:26.750
store that variable on
the left-hand side here.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.470
Now, if you get a red squiggle
under here indicating an error, and

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.570
the error says something like variable
words is accessed from within and

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.150
enter class needs to be declared final.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.930
Remember, that means that we need to
declare the words ArrayList as final, so

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.650
double check that you have
the set as final up here.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.060
So, once I know what word is clicked on,

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.660
I can get the Audio Resource ID of it
and then pass that into the MediaPlayer.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.550
So, that means I can delete this
R.raw.number_one that we've

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.190
hard coded in here, and
just use word.getAudioResourceId.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.930
There we go, and that should work.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.438
So, once the MediaPlayer is created,
we can start playing the audio file.

00:05:07.438 --> 00:05:10.570
Now I'm going to add in some
comments as well here, so

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.640
we remember what's going on.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.730
So that finished off our third step.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.110
Now the last step is to
make sure that it works for

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.540
the rest of the category activities.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.880
Now, to make the FamilyActivity work,
I copied over the MediaPlayer variable

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.485
as well as the code for
the setOnItemClickListener.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.260
Remember that when you copy and paste,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:35.000
make sure to grab the final curly brace,
closing parentheses, and semi-colon too.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.370
Also, I made the words
ArrayList final so

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.780
that I can reference it within
the item ClickListener.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.748
Now the media player needs to
reference the activity context,

00:05:43.748 --> 00:05:46.830
so I changed it from the NumbersActivity
to the FamilyActivity,

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.320
because that's the activity
that we're currently in.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.420
And then I repeated the same process for
the Colors class, and one more time for

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.240
the PhrasesActivity.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.550
Now hopefully, after setting this up
several times, you're getting the hang

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.630
of setting up ItemClickListeners
as well as using the MediaPlayer.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.986
Now let's demo the app, and we should
be able to hear Andrea's voice for

00:06:07.986 --> 00:06:08.744
all the words.

00:06:08.744 --> 00:06:10.147
So, let's start with Phrases this time.

00:06:10.147 --> 00:06:13.979
&gt;&gt; [FOREIGN]
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:14.699
And then go to Colors.

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:19.018
&gt;&gt; [FOREIGN]
&gt;&gt; Sounds good so far.

00:06:19.018 --> 00:06:20.585
Now to Family Members.

00:06:20.585 --> 00:06:23.311
&gt;&gt; [FOREIGN]
&gt;&gt; And lastly,

00:06:23.311 --> 00:06:24.277
our good old Numbers Activity.

00:06:24.277 --> 00:06:28.700
&gt;&gt; [FOREIGN]
&gt;&gt; Perfect.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.800
So I want to take a moment and

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.790
congratulate you on all
the hard work that you've done.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.400
So you've reached a really big milestone
by incorporating all these features

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.010
into this app, as well as learn so
many new skills along the way.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.420
So take a moment and
give yourselves a pat on the back.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.040
And then go show off your app
to your friends and family.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.830
We're really proud of you and
you deserve it.
