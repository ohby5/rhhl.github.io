00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.910
You gain some experience with
the media player APIs, but

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.190
you may have just copy and pasted
the lines of code that you needed.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.270
And you probably still have some
questions about how exactly it

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.280
all works.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.250
So, let's talk about that now.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.590
So, the media player is a complex class,
because it can play both audio and

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.870
video files.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.360
So, these media files can
be bundled with the app,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.230
just like how the song file was
included in our simple app earlier, or

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.160
they can be streamed from the Internet.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.260
To give you an idea of how much
the media player is capable of,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.180
here's the list of all the different
file types that the media player on

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.510
Android can support.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.780
So, you see here we can have MP3, AAC,
WAV files, and much, much, much more.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.430
By the way, the file types are just
different approaches to storing audio in

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.650
a digital form, all while minimizing
file size and maintaining sound quality.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.646
So, this is similar to how there
are different image types such as JPEG,

00:00:53.646 --> 00:00:55.232
GIF, PNG and etc.

00:00:55.232 --> 00:00:58.797
So, in the case of the MYEQ app, we're
going to provide you with MP3 files

00:00:58.797 --> 00:01:01.250
of Andrea speaking the words aloud.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.590
This way, you can include
the files within the app and

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.040
they don't need to be
streamed from the Internet.
