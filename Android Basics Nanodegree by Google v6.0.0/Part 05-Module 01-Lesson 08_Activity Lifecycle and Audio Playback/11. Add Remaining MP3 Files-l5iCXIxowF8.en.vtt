00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.560
So I downloaded all the files
from the provided GitHub link.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.830
And then, I copied those files and

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.000
pasted them into the raw
directory of our resource folder.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.540
So notice here that there should be 38
sound files in the raw directory now.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.040
So let's check that the app still runs,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.410
and there should be no visible
difference in the behavior of the app.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.075
So, the numbers activity should be
still playing only the loot D sound.

00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:27.376
&gt;&gt; Loot D, Loot D, Loot D
&gt;&gt; And

00:00:27.376 --> 00:00:30.851
all the other categories shouldn't
play any sounds just yet.

00:00:30.851 --> 00:00:40.851
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:42.937 --> 00:00:44.105
So let's fix that next.
