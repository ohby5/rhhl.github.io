00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.410
So so far we've learned
that the AudioManager class

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.880
in the Android Framework allows
us to request audio focus

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.840
when we need to play audio.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.100
And then it allows us to also
abandon audio focus afterwards.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.640
We can also register
a listener to get notified

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.040
when the audio focus state changes.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.120
Now this means that we'll
need an AudioManager

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.910
object instance of our activity so
that we can manage Audio Focus.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.720
If we take a look at this audio
focus tutorial, the section labeled

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.365
Managing Audio Focus, it says that
we can use this line of code.

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:39.120
Context.getSystemService with
an input of AUDIO_SERVICE.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.360
In order to get an instance
of Audio Manager class.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.360
Now from this line of code, we see that
the Audio Manager is a system service.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.940
Well this is the first time we've
heard about system services.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.800
So there exist system services
that provide all apps

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.890
with common functionality.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.600
So things like notification service,
or of the alarm manager service.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.320
And there are some services
that allow us to access

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.300
hardware components on device such
as the location manager service.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.180
But at the end of the day, a system
service is just a Java class and you can

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.540
interact with it by having an object
instance and then calling methods on it.
