00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.400
Now it's probably time for you to
make the code changes to your app.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.230
Use the position parameter
in that on item click method

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.430
to figure out which word to
play the pronunciation for.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.640
So I will tell you one syntax
change that you'll need to make

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.860
to all your category activity files.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.230
Now when you create
the array list of words,

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.490
we'll need to add the word final
in front of the declaration.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.320
And that way you can reference the words
arraylist within the onItemClick method.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.370
So that modification was a subtle detail
required because of variable scope and

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.380
it's okay if you don't
understand that just yet.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.180
All that you need to know is when
a clickListener is defined in line, so

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.040
here as an anonymous class,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.240
its methods can only reference local
variables if they are declared final.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.819
Or it can reference global variables
in the NumbersActivity class.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.530
So more details are included
about this in the link below.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.780
All right so go ahead and
work on this coding task.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.370
It's expected that it'll take
you a good amount of time so

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.960
be patient with yourself if
you don't get it right away.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.765
There are also some
hints below the quiz.

00:00:58.765 --> 00:01:00.855
But only use them if you get stuck.

00:01:00.855 --> 00:01:04.644
So to reiterate, for this task,
within the NumbersActivity,

00:01:04.644 --> 00:01:08.025
play the correct sound file for
each word when it's clicked.

00:01:08.025 --> 00:01:11.255
And then repeat the same process for
the other category activities.

00:01:11.255 --> 00:01:13.935
And then check this
box when you're done.

00:01:13.935 --> 00:01:16.765
So this is what your options
look like when you're complete.

00:01:16.765 --> 00:01:17.679
Tap into numbers.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:20.550
&gt;&gt; Booty.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.230
&gt;&gt; Our good old Booty is working.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.899
Let's check out the other activities.

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:25.710
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:35.116
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:01:35.116 --> 00:01:36.320
So see you on the other side.
