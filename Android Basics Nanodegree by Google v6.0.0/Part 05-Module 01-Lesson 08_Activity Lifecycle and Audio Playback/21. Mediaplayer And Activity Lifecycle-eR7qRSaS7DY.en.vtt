00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.730
The last coding task that we did for
the mewalk app involved

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.190
releasing the media player resources
as soon as we didn't need them anymore.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.020
But we can't always assume that the
audio file will be played to completion.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.605
Because if it's interrupted by the user
switching away to a different activity

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:16.935
then we still need to make sure
to clean up everything properly.

00:00:16.935 --> 00:00:19.995
So my question to you is that
if the user leaves the activity,

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:24.055
during which activity lifecycle
stage should we release resources

00:00:24.055 --> 00:00:25.785
used by the MediaPlayer?

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:30.870
So is it during onResume,
onCreate OnStop or onDestroy?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.930
So once you've made your selection,
modify your app so

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.110
that we can actually release resources
during that lifecycle stage.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.250
So let me show you what your
app should look like before and

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.490
after making this code change.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.730
So your app currently behaves like this.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.027
If I click on a word,
it'll start speaking the word aloud, and

00:00:50.027 --> 00:00:52.703
if I leave the activity
without letting it finish,

00:00:52.703 --> 00:00:55.649
the app will still continue
to play the full audio file.

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.530
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.680
&gt;&gt; So, here's the version of the code
where we cleaned up media resources

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.500
properly according to
the activity lifecycle.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.820
So, in this case,
when we hit the device home button.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.820
The app should immediately
stop playing the audio file,

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.290
even in the middle of a word.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.290
This reinforces the fact that
we should only play audio

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.180
when the user is within our app.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.780
Because in our case,
we are a music or podcast player app.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.054
So let me demonstrate.

00:01:24.054 --> 00:01:25.471
[SOUND].

00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:28.140
All right so go ahead and
make those code changes now.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.650
And remember to update all
four of our activities.
