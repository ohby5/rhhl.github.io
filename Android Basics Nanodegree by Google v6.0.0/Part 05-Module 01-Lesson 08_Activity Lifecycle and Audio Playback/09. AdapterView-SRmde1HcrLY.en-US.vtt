00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.350
Remember back in lesson two we
learned that a ListView is just

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:04.960
one type of an AdapterView.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.020
Another type of AdapterView
that we looked at was GridView.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.740
So, here we are looking at
the ListView documentation and

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.190
in it we see the class hierarchy
diagram for the ListView.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.110
Remember that a tree diagram shows what
class inherits from another class.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.850
And at each level
the code was extended and

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.770
then extra code was
added via a subclass.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.410
Now from this diagram we can
verify that the ListView

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.012
is a subclass of the AdapterView class.

00:00:29.012 --> 00:00:31.180
An AdaptorView has fields and
methods for

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.712
a view group whose children
are populated from an adapter and

00:00:33.712 --> 00:00:38.650
the ListView can inherit States and
methods from this AdapterView class and

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.300
then add on its own code to customize
it for the specific list case.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.220
Let's take a look more closely at
the set on item click Listener method.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.910
So, this method is actually defined
in the AdapterView superclass.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.600
So, let's click into it, and
notice when we dive deeper into it

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.230
we jump into the AdapterView
reference page.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.920
So, to reiterate the set
OnItemClickListener was

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.020
defined in the AdapterView class.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.580
Now the AdapterView defines the input of
this method to be an OnItemClickListener

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.860
object, which is defined
within the AdapterView class.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.320
So, let's click into that.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.650
So, this OnitemClickListener object is
defined within the AdapterView class and

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.019
that's why it's referred to as
AdapterView.OnItemClickListerner.
