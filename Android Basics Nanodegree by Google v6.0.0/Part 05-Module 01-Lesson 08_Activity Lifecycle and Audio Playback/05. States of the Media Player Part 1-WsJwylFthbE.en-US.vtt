00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.230
Let's do a quick exercise to demonstrate
the states of a media player.

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.360
But you're going to be playing
the part of the media player.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.560
So sit down for a moment and
wait for my first instruction.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.710
Now think of a song in your head and
prepare to sing it.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.478
All right.
Now start singing it aloud.

00:00:14.478 --> 00:00:17.919
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.000
And pause.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.100
Now I'd like you to resume
where you left off.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.448
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:24.448 --> 00:00:26.260
And now stop!

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.450
And completely forget that song.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.530
Now I want you to think of
an entirely different song but

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.780
don't sing aloud just yet.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.586
Alright, start singing it now.

00:00:36.586 --> 00:00:39.177
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:39.177 --> 00:00:41.720
And stop great job.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.940
Take a moment, sit back and relax.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.540
So why did I make you sing.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.570
Well to help explain this concept.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.550
So playing the audio files
within the MediaPlayer class

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.050
is managed via a state machine.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.960
And this means that there are different
states that we can transition between

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.010
as the media player plays a song.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.240
So we can draw a diagram known
as a state machine diagram

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.080
to help visualize the different
states the media player can be.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.490
So first off is idle state, which means
that the media player object is just

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.730
sitting there Idle,
not making any sound.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.350
And this is just like how you were idle,
sitting there waiting for

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.480
my instructions.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.380
Following that is the prepared state,
meaning that the media player

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.480
is preparing to play a certain
audio file like a song.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.960
And this is just like how you
were thinking about a song and

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.270
preparing to sing it, but
didn't make any sound just yet.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.690
And then comes the Started state,

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.470
meaning that the media player is playing
a certain audio file like our song.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.750
So this is similar to when you
started to sing the song aloud.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.930
&gt;&gt; Row, row, row your boat,
gently down the stream.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.640
And then comes the pause state
when you want to pause the song.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.020
And this is like when
you pause your singing.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.980
Now from the Paused state you can
move back to the Started state.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.776
If you want to resume
the song where you left off

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:53.076
[MUSIC].

00:01:53.076 --> 00:01:55.381
Now any time you can
stop singing the song,

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:58.600
meaning that the media
player is in its stop state.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.820
Now there's one catch.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.590
Once you stop the media player,
you can't resume it again.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.240
You need to set it up to prepare to
sing it again by specifying which song

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.100
you want to play.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.889
So either the same or a different song.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.310
And that's why I had you think of
a different song and prepare to sing it.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.680
And then I had you sing the new song,
moving us back to the started set again.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.490
&gt;&gt; ABCDEFG
&gt;&gt; As you can see, there are a number of

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.340
different states to the media player
&gt;&gt; Use the control how audio is played

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.040
back to the user.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.640
And again this is referred to
as a state machine diagram.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.270
We actually presented a simplified
version of the MediaPlayer life cycle

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.640
in order to help you understand
the big picture first.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.590
Now the official documentation
page contains the complete

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.290
state machine diagram.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.670
Which usually virtue in the future, so

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.220
at first I know we can
all a very overwhelming.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.352
But notice that the diagram has to say,
so we talked about, so idle, prepared,

00:02:52.352 --> 00:02:57.000
started, paused, stopped,
and a couple other ones.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.950
Know that it also provides details
on what media play methods

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.980
we can call in order to
transition between these states.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.260
So feel free to take a look at
the state diagram on your own and

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.600
we've linked it below in the notes.
