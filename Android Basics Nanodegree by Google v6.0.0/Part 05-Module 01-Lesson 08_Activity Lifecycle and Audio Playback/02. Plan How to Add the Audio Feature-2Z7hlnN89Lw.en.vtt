00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.400
Now for question one,
we had to come up with a plan.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.760
So I feel like adding audio is going to
be similar to adding images to the app

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.580
because we have additional pieces of
information for each word in the app.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.960
So I read the steps that
we did in lesson 3 and

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.059
came up with this summarized list
of tasks for adding images the app.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.900
And now I can modify those tasks.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.850
So that instead of referencing
images the tasks apply to adding

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.090
audio to the app.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.490
So our steps are, one, modify list
item layout to include a play button.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.200
Second, handle clicking on a list
item to play an audio file.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.180
And then we can add in
all the audio files.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.900
After that, modify the Word class
to store an audio resource ID.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.830
We can play the correct
audio file per word.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.030
And lastly,
we can do the fun part of visual polish.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.660
So let's go ahead and write that in for
the answer to question one.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.200
All right, so we have a good plan for
what steps we need to do.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.660
Of course, there will always be some
more steps that come up as we start

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.485
writing the code and realize there's a
lot more things we need to take care of.

00:00:55.485 --> 00:00:57.705
So this list may eventually evolve.

00:00:57.705 --> 00:01:00.605
Now let's move on to the next
question how do you play an audio

00:01:00.605 --> 00:01:02.025
file in Android?

00:01:02.025 --> 00:01:06.025
To find an answer you could either
ask a fellow Android developer or

00:01:06.025 --> 00:01:09.445
just search online for
something like play audio Android.

00:01:09.445 --> 00:01:13.290
Now our first result here looks good

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.350
because it's from
a developer.android.com website.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.780
Let's click into that.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.950
Now when I come across an article or

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.170
tutorial, I don't read
through all the details.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.900
I know this page can look intimidating
because it contains a lot of words that

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.340
you may not recognize.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.660
But don't worry,

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.650
we're just trying to get a high level
idea of what we need to use in Android.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.110
So you can start off by
reading this first paragraph.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.520
Which says that you can
play either audio or

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.717
video files using the MediaPlayer class.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.060
If you scroll down a bit farther
we see this basic section

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.710
which talks about two classes
in Android that you need to use.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.800
So it looks like we need
something called the MediaPlayer

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.690
which is the primary way
to play sound in Android.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.130
There's something called
an Audio Manager.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.610
And I am not sure what that does right
now, but we can figure that out later.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.880
Now, scrolling down a bit lower it
talks about the manifest declarations.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.340
So that's kind of a confusing and
unfamiliar phrase for now, so

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.290
let's skip over that part.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.320
So below that we have the section
called Using MediaPlayer and

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.210
it contains some code snippet examples.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.087
So all this looks pretty useful.

00:02:17.087 --> 00:02:19.300
So we might come back to that later.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.240
Now scrolling through the rest the page
there's a bunch of other sections

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.320
that looked pretty detailed.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.970
Some things are easy to recognize and

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.100
others are a little bit more
challenging and that's expected.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.660
For now we won't read
through the rest of the page

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.280
there's a lot of good information
here that we can come back to

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.900
when we need the working
details of the code.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.770
So we did a little bit of research and
found that in Android,

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.190
we can use the MediaPlayer class
to help us play an audio file.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.020
So we don't need to know
everything about how it works or

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.390
even how to use it, but at the very
least we now know that it exists.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.158
So we're off to a great
start with this feature.

00:02:52.158 --> 00:02:53.080
But let's keep going.
