00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.955
So here we have our skeleton code for the PokemonApp.

00:00:03.955 --> 00:00:08.355
If we go into app, source, main,

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:11.000
java, we have two Java files.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.235
MainActivity and HttpHandler.

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:17.345
Let's look at the MainActivity file first.

00:00:17.345 --> 00:00:19.260
The first thing to notice is that you'll see

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.050
a few red lines in the code, but don't worry.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.615
As soon as you finish this practice set those lines should go away.

00:00:25.615 --> 00:00:30.585
We see that there is a GetPokemon class with a doInBackground at it.

00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:38.595
We have an HttpHandler and a string url with this link. Let's click on it.

00:00:38.595 --> 00:00:41.734
So, here we have the JSON data for each Pokemon,

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:46.290
and each Pokemon will have its respective unique attributes.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.975
So for example, it will have an integer attribute called id,

00:00:49.975 --> 00:00:54.660
a string attribute called num and a couple other attributes.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.430
There is also an attribute type with an array that holds several strings.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.665
The thing to notice here is that each Pokemon will have a different set of attributes.

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:08.065
And we'll be using its attributes to display in our app.

00:01:08.065 --> 00:01:10.465
Going back to the MainActivity.

00:01:10.465 --> 00:01:14.760
Let's keep going. There are several TODO tasks for you to do.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.220
So just make a request to the URL and create a new JSONObject.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.285
There's also a for loop that will go through all the Pokemons

00:01:24.285 --> 00:01:29.490
and put them in a list that we'll be using to display over here.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.355
Next, let's look at our HttpHandler file.

00:01:34.355 --> 00:01:41.265
Here, there is a method called makeHttpRequest and we will pass in the URL.

00:01:41.265 --> 00:01:46.970
Here is where we make the request to make a connection with the URL.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.570
Next, let's look in the res file and layout.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.380
These files are provided for you,

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.725
so you don't have to worry about how to display each Pokemon.

00:01:56.725 --> 00:02:00.715
This is a simple list format that will display each Pokemon.

00:02:00.715 --> 00:02:04.490
And this is what each list item will have.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.150
There is a box for a name,

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.055
an id and a candy.

00:02:11.055 --> 00:02:17.820
These files will organize the information you're parsing into a simple list format.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.140
So in the next few sections,

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.840
we'll be fill in these blanks to

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.780
list out all of the Pokemons with three of their attributes.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.860
Their name, their id and their candy.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.180
This is what the final product should look like.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.340
You will see that the name is at the top. So, Bulbasaur.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.668
This is their id and this is their candy.

00:02:39.668 --> 00:02:41.050
And if I scroll down,

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.790
you'll find that each Pokemon will have different attributes.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.110
So, let's get started.
