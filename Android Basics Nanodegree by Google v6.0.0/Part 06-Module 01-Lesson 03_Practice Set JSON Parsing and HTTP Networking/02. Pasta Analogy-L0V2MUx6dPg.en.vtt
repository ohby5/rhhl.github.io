Hi my name's Vicky,

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.320
and I'm one of the Content Developers here at Udacity.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.965
We just finished learning about HTTP networking in JSON parsing.

00:00:09.965 --> 00:00:12.720
We're now going to go through a food analogy to better

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.270
understand how all of these concepts fit together.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.620
Pretend you have a huge craving for pasta.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.175
So you're at your favorite pasta restaurant.

00:00:22.175 --> 00:00:27.200
You tell the waiter you want to order specifically the red sauce pasta dish.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.715
This order information represents the address.

00:00:30.715 --> 00:00:32.955
Now the waiter has your order information,

00:00:32.955 --> 00:00:37.320
which is equivalent to the address used to retrieve that information.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.085
The waiter then uses this information to go fetch your food in the main thread.

00:00:42.085 --> 00:00:44.520
While the waiter is fetching your dish,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.190
you can do other stuff while waiting,

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.530
such as drink water in the background thread.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.248
Once you receive your pasta,

00:00:51.248 --> 00:00:52.674
you can now go through it,

00:00:52.674 --> 00:00:56.030
just like how you would go through that information from the main thread.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.045
In this case, the food order information represents the address,

00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:04.050
and the food represents JSON, which is the data.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.480
The waiter retrieving your food is the process of

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.116
HTTP networking in the background thread,

00:01:09.116 --> 00:01:12.355
while you continue to do things in the main thread.

00:01:12.355 --> 00:01:15.910
Lastly, going through your food is parsing JSON.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.025
Let's recap what we went through.

00:01:18.025 --> 00:01:20.235
When we request the pasta dish,

00:01:20.235 --> 00:01:22.425
that represents the JSON data.

00:01:22.425 --> 00:01:25.380
Communicating my request to the waiter and waiting for

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.295
the waiter to retrieve my dish is HTTP networking.

00:01:29.295 --> 00:01:33.000
Going through my food and getting what I want is JSON parsing.
