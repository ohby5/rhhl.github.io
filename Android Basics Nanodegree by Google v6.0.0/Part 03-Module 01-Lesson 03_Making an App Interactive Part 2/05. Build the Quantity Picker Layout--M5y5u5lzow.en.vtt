00:00:00.345 --> 00:00:04.298
Whoa, that was a tough concept,
but you handled it really well.

00:00:04.298 --> 00:00:08.210
This unlocks the ability to build some
really awesome layouts in Android

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.420
because almost all screens contain
some type of nested layouts,

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.080
which Correll was actually mentioning
earlier in the Google Play app.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.980
After all of that prep work,
now we're ready to go back into

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.630
Android Studio land to implement the
changes for an improved quantity picker.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.620
In case you're wondering, Katherine,
what if I'm trying to build a layout and

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.230
I don't have three
options of XML layouts

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.360
magically appear before me
that I have to choose from.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.920
Well, that's a fair question.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.390
So far we've practiced
being able to read XML and

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.500
draw a view hierarchy diagram.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.708
We've also practiced
reading XML layouts and

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:44.600
drawing a sketch of what
the screen would look like.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.610
But now it's time to practice seeing
a design of what we want to build and

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.920
being able to write the XML from it.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.380
I do realize that I gave you
the solution XML in the previous quiz.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.190
I was somewhat paying attention, but I
don't want you to look at that solution.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.550
I want you to practice the skill
of seeing a screenshot or

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.480
a mock of what you want to build and
then being able to write the XML for it.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.835
Normally, we would start
with the desired screenshot

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:10.135
of what we want to build.

00:01:10.135 --> 00:01:13.085
You can get this from a designer
that's working on your team who's

00:01:13.085 --> 00:01:13.985
designing the app for you.

00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:16.215
Or if you're working without a designer,

00:01:16.215 --> 00:01:18.795
you could also sketch
this out on your own.

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:22.367
Then you would imagine how to break
this down into views and ViewGroups.

00:01:22.367 --> 00:01:26.797
You can mark it up and then try to draw
out the view hierarchy diagram for

00:01:26.797 --> 00:01:30.327
the relationship between
the children and the parent views.

00:01:30.327 --> 00:01:33.617
After you finish this diagram, you can
start writing out the skeleton for

00:01:33.617 --> 00:01:36.437
what the XML layout
code would look like.

00:01:36.437 --> 00:01:38.297
I'll leave these parts
as an exercise for you.

00:01:38.297 --> 00:01:43.157
You'll make your changes in
the activity_main.xml layout file.

00:01:43.157 --> 00:01:45.197
Aside from writing your XML here and

00:01:45.197 --> 00:01:49.220
seeing a preview of it, you can
also click on the design pane here.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.240
This is Design tab as
opposed to the Text tab.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.690
The Design pane allows you to drag and
drop views onto the device.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.950
You can also see the component
tree in the top right corner here.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.930
This is, essentially, a tree of
all the views in your hierarchy.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.030
Currently we have vertical LinearLayout,
that's the parent view, and

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.180
all these children views inside of it.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.420
If you had nested ViewGroups,
they would also show up here.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.790
Now go ahead and
build this layout in Android Studio.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.870
After you've selected and positioned
the views, remember to style them so

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.290
it looks like this.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.420
The style of the views
is mostly the same,

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.620
except note that there's eight dp of
space in-between the minus button and

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.330
the two and in-between the two and
the plus button.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.710
As mentioned earlier,
avoid looking at the code and

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.710
try implementing it yourself.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.410
When you're done,
check this box to continue.
