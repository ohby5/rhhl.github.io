00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.400
So our students have been learning about
variables and data types in this lesson.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.120
Particularly about integers and strings.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.030
Are there examples in the apps that
you've worked on of these things?

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.970
&gt;&gt; Yes, there are plenty.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.840
So, strings and integers are everywhere.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.850
In Gmail for example, when you first
open your email it tells you how many

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.990
unread messages that you have, so
that's a very, very important number.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.710
And we actually have
these very subtle bugs,

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.820
that the number might not match exactly
how many unread messages you have.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.463
So.
[CROSSTALK]

00:00:37.463 --> 00:00:38.271
&gt;&gt; I've never had encountered

00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:38.788
that, have you?

00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:39.550
&gt;&gt; That's good.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.630
&gt;&gt; That you've never encountered that.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.328
So, yeah, but these are, you know,
it's an interesting problem to solve,

00:00:45.328 --> 00:00:49.620
because for Gmail,
we actually sync that number first.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.010
Like sync means like,

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.770
I'm fetching my data from
the Cloud to my Android device.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:55.910
So, that data is actually,

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.790
that number, is synced separately
from your actual email.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.820
So, they could potentially
go out of sync.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.790
That is one of the very trickier issues.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.210
&gt;&gt; Okay, so we were established that the
number of unread emails is a variable.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.460
It's data type would be.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.344
&gt;&gt; It would be an integer.

00:01:12.344 --> 00:01:13.200
&gt;&gt; It would be an integer.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.280
It's value is being
calculated across devices.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.560
And it's value is changing based
on the use case of the scenario.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.650
I use it as experience.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.260
&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.110
And another use of integers, so

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.450
that's an example of a variable integer,
basically it could change.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.510
Another example is ID's.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.080
So for ID's it's actually very important
that the integer stays the same.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.351
&gt;&gt; So my email ID, particularly.

00:01:36.351 --> 00:01:37.260
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.200
So the email ID on the server
that represents that

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.680
email needs to be exactly the same
as the ID that's on the client.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.150
Because that's the way
we uniquely identify

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.260
this email everywhere
across all your devices.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.320
&gt;&gt; So this is for our conversation
email, not like an email address.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.930
&gt;&gt; Yes, for our conversation, so for
in Gmail for example the whole thread.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.460
So the email thread which has multiple
messages in it, the whole thread we call

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.390
a conversation, it has a conversation
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay, I see.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.460
&gt;&gt; And then each message itself
also has its own unique ID.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.330
&gt;&gt; Okay, and each one of these ID's is
stored in a variable who's data type is?

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.010
&gt;&gt; Integer again.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.840
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.040
&gt;&gt; Yes
&gt;&gt; How many

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.640
emails are going out in a day.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.410
Do you know?

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.580
This is a lot of numbers.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.160
&gt;&gt; Yes, I do, I do not know on
top of my head how many emails.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.320
&gt;&gt; I'd imagine that if each message
in a conversation is unique and

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.570
each email is unique across
all emails that are going.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.190
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.580
&gt;&gt; That should be a very large number,
right?

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.690
&gt;&gt; So that's a very good question.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.810
So instead of int actually for
these we use logs.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.542
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Because it's a 64 bit.

00:02:40.542 --> 00:02:41.784
&gt;&gt; So then we will never.

00:02:41.784 --> 00:02:43.655
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; So long just gives you more space to

00:02:43.655 --> 00:02:45.070
hoard a larger number, right?

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.284
That's really the difference
between Inter Long?

00:02:46.284 --> 00:02:49.642
Okay.
&gt;&gt; How about any strings?

00:02:49.642 --> 00:02:51.660
&gt;&gt; Strings.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.460
&gt;&gt; I'd imagine it's subjective.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.530
A string, or how is that stored?

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah, everything.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.420
Yeah, subject is a string itself.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.660
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.510
&gt;&gt; And
obviously email addresses are strings.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.560
That's very important.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.980
And almost everything
that you see in any app,

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.960
like virtually everything that
has text will be a string.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.130
And I think a good engineer
doesn't have to know everything.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.070
But you really,

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.010
you have to be good at like figuring
out like, you know where the answer is.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.060
You can probably look for, there's
a lot of good tutorials out there for,

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.720
just have to know how to look for
the right key words.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.850
Search for the right key words.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.470
&gt;&gt; If you also ask people for help.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.610
&gt;&gt; Oh yes,
that is actually very important.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.880
I think almost always I regret
not asking people earlier.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.830
You know I could like try to fix
something, for like a whole day, and

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:45.800
at the end of the day,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.490
said okay, maybe I should have
asked whoever wrote this component.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.610
So yeah, I think reaching out to
people early is definitely valuable,

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.500
to save very valuable time.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.000
And also just being more aware of what
other projects are going on at Google.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.140
I think the, or at your own, around you.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.270
I think the really good engineers,
they're not only focus on what they're

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.870
doing, but they we have these
things called tech talks at work.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.769
&gt;&gt; Which are available publicly for

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.420
people to view,
at least some of them are.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.140
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.839
Some of them are, yes.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:26.330
So their often know what the latest
technologies are, from these tech talks

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.600
or announcements that are sent
to the entire engineering org.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.340
So, just being on top of.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.320
&gt;&gt; And let's go back to the time when
you were actually learning to program.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.340
If you could talk to
the Alice at that time,

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.440
what advice would you give her today?

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.680
&gt;&gt; Wow.
That's a very interesting question.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.980
I feel like I should have had
more fun with programming.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.458
So, I think the way I
learned to program, and

00:04:57.458 --> 00:05:02.240
I think it's very different now, because
I grew up in, originally I'm from China.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.100
So I think it was very
academically focused.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.461
Like, I went to these extracurricular
classes that tlike taught via teacher,

00:05:11.461 --> 00:05:15.781
and then we'd get assignments
like you learn to solve them, and

00:05:15.781 --> 00:05:17.790
learn to solve this problem.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.447
And I think, looking back,

00:05:23.447 --> 00:05:31.100
I wish I had like done
more fun-type projects.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.130
&gt;&gt; Would you make a birthday app?

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.078
A birthday app?
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:05:35.078 --> 00:05:35.898
&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly,

00:05:35.898 --> 00:05:40.322
like, these type of apps I
think I could learn a lot more.

00:05:40.322 --> 00:05:44.280
Because it's not just about
there's one right answer.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.310
But in like doing an app
like that I can learn about

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.240
design if its a birthday app.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.645
I learn about different UI
components its not just about,

00:05:52.645 --> 00:05:56.100
okay you need to send this
data from here to here.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:01.117
And then solve it more efficiently.

00:06:01.117 --> 00:06:06.240
I think in real life that is what,
you know, engineering is more about.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.250
It's about not just solving
a technical challenge, but

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.560
also creating a great product.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.800
&gt;&gt; Sort of like being driven
by your own curiosity.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.790
&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:16.790
Yes.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.290
&gt;&gt; Well, Cathy and
I want to thank you for your time.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:20.250
&gt;&gt; You're very welcome.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.008
&gt;&gt; I think our students will benefit
a lot from your perspective.

00:06:23.008 --> 00:06:23.508
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.
