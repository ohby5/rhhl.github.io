00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.760
Let's go over the answers
to these quiz questions.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.689
Each of these lines of code
creates a string variable and

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.150
I wanted to know what is the value
that goes inside the string variable.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.020
That means we need to evaluate this
expression which includes string

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.340
concatenation.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.080
Part a says, String orderNumber
= "Order number:" + 23.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.583
The value that gets stored in
this variable is Order number;23.

00:00:26.583 --> 00:00:30.129
Notice that there's no space
after the semicolon because

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:32.817
the end quote is right
after the semicolon.

00:00:32.817 --> 00:00:35.975
Since this is a string literal
concatenated with a integer literal,

00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:38.870
then the whole thing
just turns into a string.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.324
For part b, the right-hand side
of the equal sign evaluates

00:00:42.324 --> 00:00:45.140
to the string You were served by Jack.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.060
There's a space here
because there's a space

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.060
right before we have the end quote.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.740
For part c, this string evaluates to
You are2cups away from a free drink.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.280
The number 2 is an integer literal
value here because it's not in quotes.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.760
It's just a plain number 2.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.370
Since we have an integer
concatenated with a string,

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.450
it just becomes a string, and all
these parts are combined together, so

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.900
we pretend to squish them together.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.420
And that's why there's
no spaces right here,

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.765
because there's no space after the are
and there's no space before the cups, so

00:01:16.765 --> 00:01:19.670
are2cups is all combined with no spaces.
