00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.590
When planning how to build this layout,
we're going to start with the assumption

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.570
that we're going off of what
we currently have in our app.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.370
We're not building this from scratch.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.080
For step one,

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.790
selecting the views, we actually already
have all the views that we need.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.010
There's no need to add or remove views.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.150
We should have three buttons and
four TextViews in our layout.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.820
For step two,

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.680
positioning the views, I first describe
what the layout looks like to me.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.560
I see a header followed by a row
of buttons and a TextView.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.580
Then I see another header and
another TextView.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.689
And, lastly,
that it's followed by an Order button.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.590
&gt;From this observation, I notice that we
can't just use a vertical LinearLayout

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.610
because this item here is made
up of more than one view.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.130
We could potentially
consider RelativeLayout, but

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.540
I'm going to leave
a question mark by that.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.780
For step three,
we want to style the views.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.165
The style actually remains pretty
much the same as we had before.

00:00:51.165 --> 00:00:53.795
Although I do notice
that this quantity value

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:57.605
has a little bit of space between
the minus button and the plus button.

00:00:57.605 --> 00:00:59.915
So we might want to achieve
this with either padding or

00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:01.235
margin around this TextView.
