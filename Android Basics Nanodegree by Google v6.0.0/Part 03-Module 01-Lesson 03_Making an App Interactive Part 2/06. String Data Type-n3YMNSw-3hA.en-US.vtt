00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.510
So, far we've built a quantity picker.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:03.100
&gt;&gt; Right.
And

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.130
the next place to go in
the app is the price.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.750
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.900
The price is right.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.540
So, price is an integer so far, but
we want to move beyond that and

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.940
use strings.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.170
&gt;&gt; You mean, this type of string?

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.040
&gt;&gt; No I mean like this type of string.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.540
&gt;&gt; Huh.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.800
&gt;&gt; So a string is just
a sequence of characters.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.290
&gt;&gt; So wait.
How does this work with the price then?

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.345
&gt;&gt; So we're going to change
the screen so that it says total.

00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:30.809
And then $15.

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:34.870
So it's not just a number,
now it has some text with it as well.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.050
&gt;&gt; Numbers and text.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Isn't that awesome?

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.890
This is from the party that you may or
may not have [LAUGH] been invited to.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.530
Over the next few videos we'll
talk about using strings

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.370
in our Just Java app.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.220
Specifically, we'll learn how to create
and update string variables in the app.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.520
Then we'll change the app so that under
the price header it says total, $15 or

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.720
whatever the price is based
on the quantity ordered.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.680
We'll also show the text,

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.570
Thank you, because we're excited
about having any customers at all.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.350
You might be wondering why don't
we just put all of this text

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.430
inside the XML layout?

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.860
Well, we could, but the problem is
that the quantity can change and

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.990
when we hit the order button,
we want the price to be updated here.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.480
So this text needs to accurately reflect
the price based on the quantity.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.070
By using a string variable, we can
change the value of the text while

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.839
the app is running without having to
hard code it into the whole XML layout.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.312
Here's an example from real
apps that you may recognize.

00:01:32.312 --> 00:01:35.636
When you receive an incoming call
you see the person's name at the top

00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:37.090
of the screen.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.550
We can't put this name
directly into the XML layout

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.240
because it will change depending on who
calls you, unless all your family and

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.400
friends are called Britta Holt.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.670
The best thing to do is to store
this name in a string variable.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.240
That way you can update it
depending on who calls you.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.670
Then when we show this screen we
can just display the latest name

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.890
that is stored in that variable.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.169
In the News and Weather app,
we see a list of the top news stories.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.600
When we build the XML layout,
we can't just specifically hard code

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.820
these specific news stories
into the XML layout.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.970
As much as I love reading
about the Winter Olympics,

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.870
I do want to see other
news articles as well.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.260
So we can store the information for
each news story,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.160
like the article title, as a string
variable, because that can change.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.990
For the next task I'm going to
provide you with some code and

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.590
I'm going to have you make
those changes in your app.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.990
Then you'll run the app and
then observe what happens.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.620
I'll ask you some questions to
see if you can try to figure out

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.290
what's going on.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.840
The first change is to modify
the submitOrder method.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.020
You can remove the code that's
already in between the opening and

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.190
closing braces and then replace
it with these two lines of code.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.090
Adding this code will give you an error,
so I want you to also

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.090
add the displayMessage method, which
we've provided in the instructor notes.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.360
In the instructor notes,
you'll find this Gist of code.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.900
Go ahead and select the whole thing,

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.360
from the comment all the way
to the last closing brace.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.560
You can treat this
method like a black box,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.750
you don't have to worry about what's
going on Inside of the method, you just

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.210
need to know that you want to add it to
the MainActivity so that you can use it.

00:03:11.662 --> 00:03:12.830
Back in Android Studio,

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.100
in the MainActivity.java file,
I'm going to paste in this new method.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.110
I can paste it anywhere
in the MainActivity, but

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.870
I'm just going to put it right
after the displayPrice method.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.120
And I'm going to put it after

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.247
the closing brace of
the displayPrice method.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.362
Notice that it's also inside of
the closing brace of the MainActivity.

00:03:32.362 --> 00:03:34.790
The MainActivity has
an opening brace right here,

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.260
and everything inside of it is
contained within the MainActivity.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.898
And then you have a closing brace for
the MainActivity here.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.040
Once we've added
the displayMessage method in,

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.890
we can now modify
the submitOrder method.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.420
I'm going to erase the code
that we already have inside

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.030
the submitOrder method.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.518
Then according to the quiz image,
I'm going to add the new code here.

00:03:57.226 --> 00:04:01.020
Intentionally I'm not giving you too
many details on what I just did.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.910
I want you to try it out in your
version of the app, run it, and

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:04.730
see what happens.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.990
After that I want you to
answer these questions.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.200
What happens when you click on
the order button in the app now?

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.250
If you take a look at the submit
order code more closely,

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.140
we actually created a string variable.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.430
Even though we haven't gone over the
code for string variables, I want you to

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.090
make your best guess as to,
what do you think the variable name is?

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.990
And what do you think
the variable value is?

00:04:28.538 --> 00:04:30.000
When you are done go ahead and continue.
