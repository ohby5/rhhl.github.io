00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.880
With the pen and
paper still in your hand, go ahead and

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.210
sketch out what each option
would look like on a device.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.470
You can refer to the view hierarchy
diagrams that we created in the last

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.330
quiz, if that helps you.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.860
Also, as you're reading
through each XML file,

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.950
make sure that you read each attribute
carefully, so you don't miss anything.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.010
When you're done with those three
sketches, I want you to decide on which

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.890
option gives you the desired
layout that we want.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.620
These are radio buttons instead of
check boxes, so you can only pick one.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.120
Good luck.
