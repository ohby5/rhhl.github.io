00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.130
Our student just learned Java.

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:02.950
&gt;&gt; That's amazing.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:03.560
&gt;&gt; It's huge.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.800
&gt;&gt; It is huge.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.420
They also learned how to
add a button on the app.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.220
Click on the button,
something happens magically.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.217
It's called event-driven programming.

00:00:10.217 --> 00:00:11.260
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
&gt;&gt; You know it, we know it,

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:11.860
they know it, now.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah, now they know it.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.405
And we also learned about variables.

00:00:16.405 --> 00:00:17.050
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.420
&gt;&gt; Which is what makes the quantity
picker go up and down.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.330
&gt;&gt; Correct.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.010
Alice, the Android developer,
made a guest appearance.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.920
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, Alice.
&gt;&gt; She was talking about how she gets

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.535
unstuck when she comes across a bug.

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:27.080
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.120
Those are some good tips.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.080
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.970
&gt;&gt; So, do you know what that means?

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:31.760
&gt;&gt; We're basically done.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.570
&gt;&gt; We're done with lesson two.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.070
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.060
&gt;&gt; You done with that?

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.585
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I think so.

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:38.430
&gt;&gt; because we closed an hour ago.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.310
&gt;&gt; Oh, sorry.
&gt;&gt; Oh, sorry.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.940
&gt;&gt; I'll take it from here.
