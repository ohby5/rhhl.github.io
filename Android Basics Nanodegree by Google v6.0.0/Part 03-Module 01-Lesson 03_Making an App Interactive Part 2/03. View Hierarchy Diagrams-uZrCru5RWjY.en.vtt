00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.470
I'm going to draw out the view hierarchy
diagram for options A, B, and C.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.500
We'll start with option A.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:09.960
It contains a LinearLayout
as the root view.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.098
So let me draw that.

00:00:11.098 --> 00:00:14.090
Then I want to figure out the next
layer of the view hierarchy,

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.920
which would be the direct
children of this LinearLayout.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.750
I'm going to scroll through the XML
file to figure out the direct children

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.695
of this LinearLayout.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.413
We have a TextView, a LinearLayout,
another TextView, another TextView,

00:00:26.413 --> 00:00:28.230
and then a Button.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.940
So let me draw that in.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.330
Cool, that looks good, but

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.450
we actually skipped over a bunch of
XML related to this LinearLayout.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.900
This nested LinearLayout contains
a Button, a TextView, and a Button.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.630
Let's draw those in.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.220
This is the view hierarchy diagram for
option A.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.370
At a high level, there is a parent
LinearLayout as the root view.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.510
It contains five children views,
and one of the children

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.090
actually is a LinearLayout that
contains three more views.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.550
Great, let's move on to option B.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.620
In option B, we have a parent
LinearLayout as a root view again.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.170
Now, we can figure out the direct
children of this LinearLayout.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.745
We have a TextView, a LinearLayout,
another TextView, another TextView,

00:01:10.745 --> 00:01:12.500
and a Button.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.660
This nested LinearLayout
also has more children.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.820
We have a Button, a TextView,
and another Button.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.090
Hopefully, you're getting the idea
of how to read an XML file

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.280
by looking at the outermost parent first
and then going inwards from there.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.720
And last but not least,
we have option C.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.900
The root view is a LinearLayout again.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.110
Let's look for its direct children.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.220
We have a LinearLayout followed by
a TextView, a TextView, and a button.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.480
Okay, good, so this is a view
hierarchy diagram for option C.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.190
This looks a little bit different
than the other options, so

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.489
let's compare them side by side.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.310
Here are all the options side by side.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.600
A and B have very similar view
hierarchies whereas option C

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.632
has a different view hierarchy.

00:01:55.632 --> 00:01:59.790
This LinearLayout has only four
children as opposed to five children in

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.290
the other cases.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.580
Also, since A and B look very similar,
we're going to have to look more closely

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.180
at the XML to determine what
the difference is between the two.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.940
In the next quiz, you'll look more
closely at the XML for each option.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.570
Then I'll ask you to decide
which option you think

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.970
best accurately describes
the layout that we want to build.
