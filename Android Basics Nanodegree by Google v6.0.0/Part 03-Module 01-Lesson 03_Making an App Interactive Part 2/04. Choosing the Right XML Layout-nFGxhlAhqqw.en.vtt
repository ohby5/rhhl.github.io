00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.310
I'm going to draw out
the different options for you.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.230
For Option A, we have a vertical
LinearLayout as the root view.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.900
I'm just going to draw
a big old rectangle.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.670
And I'll keep in mind that
as I add views to it,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.330
it needs to be added
in a vertical column.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.920
The first child is a TextView
that says Quantity, and

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.200
it's in all caps because it's a header.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.050
So let me draw that in.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.570
Next we have a horizontal LinearLayout.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.730
I'm going to draw it over here and
add children horizontally.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.680
The first child of this
LinearLayout is a minus button, so

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.550
I'm going to draw that here.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.520
The second child of this horizontal
LinearLayout is a TextView that

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.450
has the text two in it.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.670
The third child is a plus button,
so I'm going to add that here.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.170
All these children
are added horizontally, and

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.650
this whole horizontal LinearLayout is a
child within this vertical LinearLayout.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.830
Next, we have a TextView that
says Price, and it's in all caps.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.020
It's followed by another
TextView that says $10, and

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.460
lastly we have a Button that says Order.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.020
Nice, that actually
looks like what we want.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.920
But we'll hold off on any judgements,
and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.650
we'll keep looking at the other
options and sketch them out first.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.160
For Option B,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.110
remember that the view hierarchy
diagram was very similar to Option A.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.540
By looking at the XML more closely,

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.530
let's see if it actually
looks the same on the device.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.850
We're going to start with a horizontal
LinearLayout as the root view.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.620
As I add children, I'm going to
have to add them horizontally here.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.030
The first child is a TextView
that is the quantity header, so

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.850
let me draw that in.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.080
Next, we have a nested LinearLayout
with orientation vertical.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.630
I'm going to draw that right here so

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.970
it comes horizontally after
the quantity TextView.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.090
As I add children to this LinearLayout,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.580
I'm going to add them vertically
as in a vertical column.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.830
The first child is the minus button.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:51.520
Let me draw that.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.940
Below that we have
a TextView that says two.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.310
And below that we have a plus button.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.335
That finishes this nested LinearLayout.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.610
We also have a price TextView,
the $10, and also an Order button.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.008
Taking a step back, this doesn't
quite look like what we want.

00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:14.690
So I'm going to take a wild guess and
say Option B is not the correct answer.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.060
Let's move on to Option C.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.330
Option C had a very
different view hierarchy

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.260
in that it only had four children
under the root parent LinearLayout.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.770
This parent view is
a vertical LinearLayout.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.760
That means the children will be added
vertically one after the other.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.740
The first child is
a horizontal LinearLayout.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.840
That means I have to add the children
horizontally, one after the other.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.800
The first child is a TextView
that says quantity.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.880
Then I have a minus button, the text
that says two, and a plus button.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.300
That also looks funny,
but we'll keep going.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.420
After this plus button is
the closing tag of the LinearLayout.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.825
So after that, these children are part
of the vertical LinearLayout.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.163
So this price TextView needs to go
vertically underneath this horizontal

00:03:03.163 --> 00:03:04.140
LinearLayout.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.830
The price TextView and
the Order button are also part of

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.690
the vertical LinearLayout, so
they need to go underneath the price.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.960
This is what the layout looks like.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.850
As you can see,

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.950
this quantity TextView has been made
a child of this horizontal LinearLayout.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.370
So the quantity picker is showing up
here but also the quantity header.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.940
This difference in layout is all because

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.190
we moved the TextView to
have a different parent.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.960
In the screenshot of the desired layout,
we have the quantity

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.800
header on top of the quantity picker,
not beside each other.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.310
So we need to move this
quantity TextView to be a child

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.805
of this vertical LinearLayout and not
a child of this horizontal LinearLayout.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.250
Here are the sketches side by side.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.430
Clearly, Option B is not what we want,
and Option C is correct, except for

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.520
the fact that quantity and the quantity
picker are in the wrong spots.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.190
They should be on top of each other.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.760
That leaves Option A, which does
actually build the desired layout.
