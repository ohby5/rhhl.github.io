00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.190
To build the desired layout,
the image actually goes edge to edge, so

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.910
let's get rid of this padding
that we have on the parent view.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.270
Cool, now the image goes edge to edge.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.470
Let's fix the text down here.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.720
We mentioned that we want 16 dp of
padding all around the edges here.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.690
Okay, well, I tried to add 16 dp
of padding to this TextView, but

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.610
we originally wanted only
8 dp of padding here.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.820
So we should break this out
into individual values and

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.420
set the bottom padding to be 8 dp.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.480
Okay, now we have top, left, and
right padding equal to 16 dp, but

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.060
the bottom padding of
this TextView is 8 dp.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.610
Cool, so now this last text you
should also get 16 dp of padding.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.460
But wait, now that increases the amount
of space in between the two TextViews.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.760
Let's also add 16 dp of
padding to this last TextView.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.960
This makes the left and
bottom and right spacing correct.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.350
But now there's too much space
in between the two TextViews, so

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.460
let's break this out
into individual values.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.650
And we'll stop right there because we
don't want any top padding on this view.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.248
The correct spacing is coming
from the bottom padding of this

00:01:04.248 --> 00:01:05.241
TextView above it.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.090
Cool, so that looks correct.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.890
The only thing that's missing now is
the fact that we need to get rid of this

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.440
white space here.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.930
We don't need a bottom margin on
this ImageView, so let's delete it.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.920
Great work,
we finished building this layout.
