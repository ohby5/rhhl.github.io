00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.890
And here are some observations
that you may have made.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.230
There's no right or wrong answer here.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.230
We just want to get you in the habit
of identifying things that you do or

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.230
don't know in some code.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.730
So you may have noticed that this
starts with a opening angle bracket,

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.386
and then the name of the view.

00:00:14.386 --> 00:00:16.790
Ding [SOUND].

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.950
And then there's a bunch of attributes.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.665
[SOUND] And
then a closing angle bracket, boom.

00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:25.430
But there is no forward slash,
that may come later.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.290
You may recognize the values of width
and height, which means the sides of

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.760
the view group will shrink to
wrap the content inside of it.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.865
Then there's this new attribute
that you haven't seen before,

00:00:34.865 --> 00:00:36.330
android:orientation="vertical".

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.850
You may make some connection

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.570
with the way that these
are vertically in a column.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.830
Then there are these
two TextView elements.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.110
&gt;From looking at the attribute text,
it seems like Guest List is here and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.870
Kunal is here.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:50.960
Looks like it's a party for one.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.980
Then we have this funny
group of symbols down here.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.080
You may or may not recognize it from
earlier, but this is a open angle

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.400
bracket, forward slash Linear layout and
then close angel bracket.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.379
This is the closing tag, and
this is the opening tag.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.300
You get brownie points if you remembered
that from the beginning of the lesson.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.490
Cool.
So let's look at more code examples, and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.440
dig into this more.
