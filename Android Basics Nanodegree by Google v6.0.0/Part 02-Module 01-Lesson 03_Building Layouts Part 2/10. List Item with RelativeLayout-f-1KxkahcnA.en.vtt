00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.540
Now let's look at a more realistic
use case for a relative layout.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.070
For example,

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.380
this is a good ViewGroup to use when
you're building a list item like this.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.290
We've provided a link below with some
XML for you to get started with.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.880
Go ahead and modify it so
that you can build something like this.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.570
As a hint, first try switching from
a linear layout to a relative layout.
