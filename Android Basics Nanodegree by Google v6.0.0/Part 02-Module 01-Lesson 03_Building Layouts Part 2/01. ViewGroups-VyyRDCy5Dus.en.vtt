00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
You remember the coffee bean trail, Catherine?

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.450
How can I forget,

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.010
you spilled it all over me.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.540
So we talked about how there will be three big parts to Lesson 1,

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.030
and we spoke about image and text view.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.830
Then we learned how to style those views.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.015
Yes.

00:00:14.015 --> 00:00:15.285
Where are we going next?

00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:16.650
Well I was thinking,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.640
since we only have one view on the screen right now, it's a little boring.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.695
So we should add more than one view.

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:25.770
Right, and if you think about it all of the fun apps that we use,

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.580
YouTube, OkCupid, what's another one that comes to mind?

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.180
Gmail.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.715
Gmail. They all seem to have

00:00:31.715 --> 00:00:34.905
more than one view is packed in very neatly on the screen together.

00:00:34.905 --> 00:00:37.535
Yeah. The way they do that is through ViewGroups.

00:00:37.535 --> 00:00:39.180
So we'll learn about that next.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.325
That gives us the power to also position views on the screen where we want them.

00:00:43.325 --> 00:00:46.495
So let's talk about ViewGroups next.

00:00:46.495 --> 00:00:51.740
So far we've only had a single TextView or a single ImageView on screen.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.640
If we want to add another view below it,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.200
we could try to just copy this and paste it below it.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.880
But then we get an error.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.375
It says the XML document has more than one root view.

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:06.380
There can only be one root view and it should enclose all of your other views.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.510
If we want both of these TextViews to appear on screen and not be lonely anymore,

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.165
then we need to put them in a ViewGroup.

00:01:14.165 --> 00:01:17.815
The ViewGroup will then be the single root view for the layout.

00:01:17.815 --> 00:01:21.365
ViewGroups are also views and they are rectangles on the screen.

00:01:21.365 --> 00:01:24.890
For example, the red and orange rectangles here are all ViewGroups.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.780
They can have a width, a height,

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.255
or a background color, or other attributes.

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:30.940
Background color here is orange,

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.525
but it could also be transparent.

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:35.540
So the ViewGroup isn't even visible to the user.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.620
Instead of holding some content like text for a TextView or image for an ImageView,

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.910
the content that a ViewGroup holds is other views.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.000
You can think of a ViewGroup as being a container for views.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.540
One of view contains other views,

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.600
we call it the parent of these views.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.920
So this is a parent.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.905
This is the parent, and this is parent.

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:55.920
When a view is inside of a ViewGroup,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.220
we call it the child of that ViewGroup.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.255
So this is a child,

00:01:59.255 --> 00:02:01.100
and this is a child, and this is a child.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.215
Same here, there are two children here,

00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:04.640
and two children here.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.680
Continuing with the family language,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.570
if there are multiple children,

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.255
then each of those children are siblings to each other.

00:02:11.255 --> 00:02:15.105
So these are sibling views and these are sibling views. Okay, that was a lot.

00:02:15.105 --> 00:02:18.860
To help you remember all the terminology around parent and child,

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.360
and view and ViewGroup,

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.930
I want you to meet a very nice family called the views.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.715
You've already met Tommy TextView.

00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:28.040
He's pretty great at displaying text.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.810
You also know his sister Ivy ImageView,

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.960
who displayed very beautiful images.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.970
Now, we're meeting their parents.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.115
It's always nerve-wracking to meet the parents.

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:39.455
So we have Laura, the Linear Layout,

00:02:39.455 --> 00:02:41.630
and Ray, the Relative Layout.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.235
These are both ViewGroups,

00:02:43.235 --> 00:02:46.010
which we mentioned before are called parent views.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.580
Then the children views are positioned based on their parent.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.785
Let's look at an example of one parent.

00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:56.240
A parent may tell their child to sit or stand in a specific place and not to move.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.700
Let's ignore the possibility that the child might want to

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.340
get up and run around because that's just an edge case.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.215
On a device, this means that a parent has control over where to position its children.

00:03:06.215 --> 00:03:09.960
For example, one child TextView can be at the top of the screen,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.445
and then a second child ImageView can be below that,

00:03:13.445 --> 00:03:17.120
or if the parent wishes they can rearrange the children in a different way.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.255
The child ImageView can be on the left,

00:03:19.255 --> 00:03:22.115
and then the child TextView can be on the right.

00:03:22.115 --> 00:03:24.970
We're going to talk about ViewGroups in more detail in this lesson,

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.890
but to make sure that you've understood what we've covered so far,

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.765
please answer these questions.

00:03:29.765 --> 00:03:31.580
For the screenshot on this device,

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.520
can you tell me how many views there are?

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.655
Number 2, for the mountain image,

00:03:35.655 --> 00:03:38.795
is it a child or a parent of the red ViewGroup?

00:03:38.795 --> 00:03:44.290
Number 3, is a red ViewGroup a child or a parent of the hiking TextView.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.095
Number 4, which of these views are siblings of each other,

00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:50.700
and you can just list them here.
