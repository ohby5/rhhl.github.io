00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.880
All right, now it's time for a quiz.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.010
In the instructor notes below,

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.520
I'm going to provide you
with a link to this code.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.270
This is the XML for a RelativeLayout.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.730
I want you to read through it.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.450
Try to imagine what it would
look like on the device.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.306
I know that you're fully capable
of copying and pasting, so

00:00:16.306 --> 00:00:19.666
I don't want you to put it in the XML
Visualizer because then that will do

00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.280
all the hard work for you.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.990
In this course, we also want you to
be able to practice reading code.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.680
That means looking at some code and

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.965
then figuring out what exactly it
will translate to in your app.

00:00:30.965 --> 00:00:33.855
Experienced developers become
quite good at this because then

00:00:33.855 --> 00:00:37.065
they don't need to actually run it on a
device to know what it would look like.

00:00:37.065 --> 00:00:38.806
They can just modify the code here and

00:00:38.806 --> 00:00:42.870
just keep working on it, knowing in
their head what it would look like.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.450
For you, since you're starting off,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.020
I want you to carefully read
this as best as you can, and

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.690
then you can draw it out on a scratch
piece of paper if that helps you.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.530
Then tell me if the device would look
something like this or like this.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.520
Go ahead and click on the option
that you think best represents

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.040
what would happen on the device for
the XML that we gave you.
