If you open up the link to the XML
visualizer, that we provided

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.390
you in the instructor notes,
then this is what it would look like.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.410
We have a linear layout with a text
view that says Guest List and

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.570
another text view that says Kunal.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.020
The first task was to add more text
views to create the guest list.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.680
So let's copy and
paste this XML element.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.090
Cool, let's add some other
people besides Kunal.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.390
Let's add Kagure and also Lyla.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.570
Awesome.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.900
So now Kagure and
Lyla show up under Kunal's name.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.400
We can also change any of
the existing text use.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.220
We change to the VIP list.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.120
The second task was to change the
orientation attribute to be horizontal.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.770
This immediately changes all the text
views to appear side by side

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.500
instead of one on top of the other.
