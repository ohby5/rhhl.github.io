You will be making your own Android app - taking it from the idea stage to building out the full app. You can share your app with family and friends, as well as with other students in this course.\n\nThe goal is to create an **educational app** that quizzes a user about a certain topic of your choice. We want you to be creative about how you accomplish this. It’s up to you what the quiz questions will be about and how you want to present them to your user. (Per the rubric, we require a minimum of 4 questions and a maximum of 10 quiz questions for a proper app submission).\n \n- - - \n\n### Why this project?\n\nSo far in this Nanodegree program, we’ve built three apps together: the Happy Birthday, Court Counter and Just Java apps. At this point, we believe that you’re now ready to create your own app. You will have full ownership over the creative vision, planning, and development of the app.\nFrom what we’ve seen in the discussion forums, you each have a wealth of different experiences and unique areas of expertise. We would like to see that shine through in the app that you create.\n\n- - - \n\n### What will I learn?\nThis project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:\n\n* Planning your app design before coding.\n* Taking an app layout from drawing to XML code.\n* Creating, positioning, and styling views.\n* Creating interactivity through button clicks and Java code.\n* Commenting and documenting your code.\n\n- - - \n### Paid Nanodegree Program vs Free Course\n\nIf you are in the paid Nanodegree program, you will receive feedback after submitting your project. \n\nIf you are enrolled in the free version of this course, the project rubric and all of the project details are available to you but you will not be able to submit nor receive feedback on your work.\n\n---\n**Note:** As the focus of this program is Java, only projects completed with Java as the source code will be accepted.  Projects using Kotlin as the source code will not be accepted. ",

First, build the layout. This involves creating the quiz questions, deciding what type of quiz they will be, and  formatting them in the xml layout file for your Activity. \n \n2. Second, you'll want to write code that links the layout to the activity. For step 3, you'll want variables that refer to each of the quiz answers. \n\n3. Finally, write the code for the button which checks your answers. This code should run through each question in the app, record whether the user got the question right, and then display the quiz results in a Toast message. \n\n\nYour project will be evaluated using the [Quiz App project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/158/view).\n\n",
