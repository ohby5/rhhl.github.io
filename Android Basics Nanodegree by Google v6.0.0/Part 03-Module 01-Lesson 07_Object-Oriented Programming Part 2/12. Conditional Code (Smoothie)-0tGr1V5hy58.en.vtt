00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.695
I love smoothies.

00:00:01.695 --> 00:00:04.620
Let's look at some code from the smoothie activity.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.430
First, we create an integer variable called number of smoothies

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.850
till prize and we initialize that to value of 10.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.695
Then we have an if else statement.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:16.645
It spans from line two to line seven.

00:00:16.645 --> 00:00:20.640
If the number of smoothies till prize is greater than nine,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.225
then do the code within the opening and closing braces here.

00:00:24.225 --> 00:00:26.530
If this statement is not true,

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.505
then do the code in this else block right here.

00:00:29.505 --> 00:00:35.310
Since the number of smoothies till prize is a value of 10 and 10 is greater than nine,

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.220
then we fall into the if case here.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.450
We print out a log message that says congratulations,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.785
you get a free smoothie.

00:00:42.785 --> 00:00:48.445
Then we update the number of smoothies till prize variable to be this new value.

00:00:48.445 --> 00:00:54.045
This evaluates to 10 minus 10, which is zero.

00:00:54.045 --> 00:00:58.155
So we essentially update this to have zero smoothies.

00:00:58.155 --> 00:01:02.880
That makes sense, because once you've reached 10 smoothies and you get a free one,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.545
your count goes back to zero and you have to buy 10 more again.

00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:08.465
So this has a value of zero.

00:01:08.465 --> 00:01:11.350
Lets continue. Well, we've reached the end of

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.030
this if block of code and we skip over the else-block,

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.040
because we only do one or the other,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.080
and so we immediately go down here.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.550
In this last code statement,

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.500
we add a log message that says,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.800
you currently have blank out of 10 smoothies needed for your next free smoothie.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.240
This blank here is actually a variable called number of smoothies till prize and

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.560
this currently has a value of zero because we updated it here.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.355
So this message would say,

00:01:40.355 --> 00:01:44.120
you currently have zero out of 10 smoothies until your next free one.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.805
Therefore the answer is C. By stepping through the code,

00:01:47.805 --> 00:01:48.980
we got the message,

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.280
Congratulations you get a free smoothie and we also saw

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.915
the message you currently have zero out of 10 smoothies until your next one.

00:01:56.915 --> 00:02:00.465
Option A is incorrect because we definitely did get a free smoothie.

00:02:00.465 --> 00:02:05.720
Option B is incorrect because we updated the number of smoothies count back to zero.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.940
Nice job trying to read code that you didn't

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.895
understand before and trying to pick the answer.

00:02:10.895 --> 00:02:14.360
Continue on to learn about what exactly is going on.
