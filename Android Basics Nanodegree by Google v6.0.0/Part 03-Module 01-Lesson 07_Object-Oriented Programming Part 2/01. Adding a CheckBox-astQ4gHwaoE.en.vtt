00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.730
Let's go back to our app now,
and add a check box.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.700
This will allow the user to select if
they want the whipped cream topping on

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.220
their coffee.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.880
It will look something like this,
and then you can check this box.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.160
Go ahead and
add a check box to the app now.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.130
This will allow the user to
add a whipped cream topping

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.940
on their drink if they want.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.610
When you click on this check box
it should automatically animate to

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:20.110
this state.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.730
Also add a header that says toppings.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.650
There's only one topping now, but
we're going to add another one later.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.130
If you click on the order button,
the order summary shows, and

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.000
it's still the same as before.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.700
Eventually, we're going to modify it so

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.670
it shows whether you have
the whipped cream topping or not.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.430
For this next coding task, just focus on
adding this check box and this header.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.820
You haven't added a check
box to the layout before,

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.870
but here's your chance to learn.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.750
You can look up online how to do this or
you can check out

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.960
the Common Android Views cheat sheet,
which is linked in the instructor notes.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.840
Whichever way you decide
to figure it out,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.550
when your app launches it should
look something like this.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.080
Also note that I would like 24dp
of space in between the box and

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.890
the text whipped cream.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.349
Also use a font size of 16sp for
the whipped cream text.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.580
By the way, when I draw out specific
metrics like for spacing or

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.000
font sizes or font colors,
that's actually called red lines.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.365
Red lines are very detailed
specifications about how the visual

00:01:19.365 --> 00:01:21.265
appearance of the app should look like.

00:01:21.265 --> 00:01:23.165
If you’re a developer
working with a designer,

00:01:23.165 --> 00:01:26.705
you’ll probably get a set of red lines
for different screens in your app so

00:01:26.705 --> 00:01:29.355
that you can build
according to these specs.

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:33.540
The red lines may include values for
colors,size of views,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.350
spacing, font sizes and font colors.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.085
These are the red lines for

00:01:39.085 --> 00:01:42.350
the sunshine app in the developing
Android apps Udacity course.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.830
Keeping this in mind, go ahead and

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.600
start planning how you're going
to build out this layout.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.280
Remember the three steps that
we taught you in lesson one for

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.830
building any layout.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.730
First, select the views that you need.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.890
Then position them, and then style them.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.450
In the text boxes provided, write down
what you need to do in each step.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.080
Once you've planned it out,
then go ahead and add this to your app.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.320
Ironically, I don't have a check box for

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.139
you to check when you're
done with this task.
