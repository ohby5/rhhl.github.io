Awesome, at this point you have
completed localizing the text

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.170
in the just Java app.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.010
Hopefully you've seen that
with just a few modifications,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.870
you can open up your app
to whole new audiences.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:11.918
Let's review our solution.

00:00:11.918 --> 00:00:14.410
Here's the strings.xml file

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.390
where we pulled out all
the possible strings in our app.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.860
For each string resource
we provide a comment and

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.300
a character limit to help the translator
figure out the right translation.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.670
In our layout now we refer
to string resources.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.420
There are no more warnings from
Android Studio about hard coding

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.280
strings in our layout.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.250
And here's a Spanish version
of the strings.xml file

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.800
with all their Spanish translations.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.060
If you open up the translations editor
you can see the name of the string

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.345
resources, the English translations,
as well as the Spanish translations.

00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:50.360
Then in our layout file we can refer
to all of these string resources.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.350
And now Android Studio doesn't have
any more warnings about hard coding

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.660
strings in our layout.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.320
Within our Java code we also
refer to these string resources.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.150
Note that we also get the local
currency with this line of code here.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.020
This is a utility function that formats
the input price into the current c for

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.190
the current local.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.410
All of the solution code is
linked in instructor notes below.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.610
Gran trabajo, great job.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.220
Now let's explore further
about what else can be done

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.540
with resources in Android.
