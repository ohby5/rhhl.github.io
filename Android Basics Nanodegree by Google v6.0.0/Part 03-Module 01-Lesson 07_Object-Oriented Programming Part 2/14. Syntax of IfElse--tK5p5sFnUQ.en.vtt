00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.620
Now here's a chance for you to
practice typing out the syntax for

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.240
a control flow statement.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.689
For this given block of code here,

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.550
I want you to type it out
exactly into this blank box.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.580
Write out the Java keywords if and
else properly.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.260
And remember to include the parenthesis
around the test condition.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.080
And then remember the braces as well.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.060
When you're done typing it out,
go ahead and answer this question.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.440
If we assume that the variable
number of guests has a value of ten

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.380
at the start of this statement.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.880
Then after it's executed this statement.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.009
What is the ending value
of the variable tip?
