00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.984
We've come a long way in this course.

00:00:01.984 --> 00:00:03.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Some of our students may be feeling

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.345
ecstatic that they built
these couple of apps.

00:00:05.345 --> 00:00:07.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Although some of them may be feeling

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.250
a little bit pensive because they
realize that there is a lot to learn.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.550
&gt;&gt; There is, and
I can empathize with that feeling.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.130
When I first started at Google,
I felt out of place.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.650
I didn't know why they hired me.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.670
I just felt like an impostor.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.020
&gt;&gt; Like impostor syndrome?

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.130
&gt;&gt; Exactly, but then I realize that
other people also feel the same thing,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.720
and that made me feel more at ease.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.810
&gt;&gt; Wow, thanks for sharing.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.350
Let's do the same thing for
our students next.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.970
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.790
&gt;&gt; Here are some Googlers sharing
their stories of feeling out of place.
