00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
Invariably, you will land on a project where you don't know much about what's involved.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.860
It's completely okay to say, "You know,

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.560
I have not the slightest idea to solve this problem."

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.120
This is very normal and it is normal for every single person.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.590
I remember still just starting full-time work and realizing,

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.680
wow, I'm not sure I know how to work with big code bases here.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.835
I don't know this language and it's frightening and there's a lot you don't know.

00:00:27.835 --> 00:00:32.845
Find a little nugget you can take on and take it from there.

00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:36.070
There's a lot of times you're going to run into areas where you just,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.775
you don't know what to do and you feel like you can't make it all come together.

00:00:39.775 --> 00:00:43.195
And the most important thing is to not get caught up in that.

00:00:43.195 --> 00:00:47.575
Sometimes the best thing you can do is actually just take a little time off of a problem

00:00:47.575 --> 00:00:49.840
and then circle back a little bit later when you

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.280
have a fresher mind and then it will be easy.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.130
Imposter syndrome is the feeling that you're a

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.085
fake and somehow you snuck in and you don't deserve to be where you are.

00:01:02.085 --> 00:01:06.280
There are so many times at work where I get projects to

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.570
work on and internally I feel like there's no way I can do this,

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.975
I'm totally going to fail at it.

00:01:11.975 --> 00:01:14.775
The only person expecting me to fail is myself.

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:16.860
And so if I can get over that,

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.440
I can gain more confidence and do anything that I want to do.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.840
You have just asked me to code up something or to fix a bug,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.700
I don't even know where to begin.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.690
The best people I know learned to live with uncertainty, fear,

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.220
doubt, confusion and say and they just plowed right ahead.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.240
Failure it's going to happen if you take risks,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.565
and taking risks is important to succeed.

00:01:42.565 --> 00:01:44.815
I have a few tips on how to cope with that.

00:01:44.815 --> 00:01:49.285
Number one, is try to see the silver lining of failure.

00:01:49.285 --> 00:01:53.665
Number two, is I think preparing is really important.

00:01:53.665 --> 00:01:56.390
It will help you a lot in

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.585
taking on risks that are more manageable and being able to succeed more often.

00:02:01.585 --> 00:02:04.690
I think it's absolutely vital that when you go into

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.485
building something you accept that sometimes you're going to be wrong.

00:02:08.485 --> 00:02:11.380
If I had an opportunity to sort of go back in time and

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.260
tell a younger version of myself like just say I was getting started,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.685
what should I do?

00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:18.445
I honestly I think the main thing would be to

00:02:18.445 --> 00:02:22.535
experiment more and just always try and be learning new things.

00:02:22.535 --> 00:02:26.560
You don't have to have all of the knowledge right now,

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.740
but just realize that you can always learn it,

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.730
and the whole coding process is a learning process.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.870
So if you're in a class and it's been a while and you made progress,

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.610
first of all be proud of that progress.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:47.150
And you find yourself now feeling a little stuck, it's okay.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.130
Being overwhelmed is not a bad thing.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.210
That's my first advice.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.100
It means there's a lot of information coming your

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.970
way and you're so lucky that that is the case.
