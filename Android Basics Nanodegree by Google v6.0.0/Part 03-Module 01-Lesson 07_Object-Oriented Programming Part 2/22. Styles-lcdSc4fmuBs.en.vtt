00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.270
In our apps res values folder
we modify the styles.xml file.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.470
We added this style
called HeaderTextStyle.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.760
It contains five properties
as specified in the quiz.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.010
This is the attribute name for
the text view and this is the value.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.150
Then in the activity main layout file
we can modify all the header text views

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.980
to use this style.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.687
We specify
style="@style/HeaderTextStyle".

00:00:25.687 --> 00:00:28.290
And this is the toppings header.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.990
We do the same thing for
the quantity header.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.905
Now, if we ever want to modify
how the headers look on our app.

00:00:33.905 --> 00:00:36.135
We can just update in a single place.

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:39.405
When we run the app we can verify
that all the headers look the same.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:40.775
The app is looking great.

00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:43.025
Now there's only once more co
change that we need to do,

00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:45.665
and that is to select colors for
the theme of the app.
