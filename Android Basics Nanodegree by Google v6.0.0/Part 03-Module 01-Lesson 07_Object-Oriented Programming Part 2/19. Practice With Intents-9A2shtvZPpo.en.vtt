00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.719
Hopefully, you had a chance to
experiment with using different intents

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.110
from the Common Intents guide.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.090
For example, I showed you earlier that
I modified the submitOrder method.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.000
I commented out all the existing code
and then, added the maps intent code.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
When I run the map on my device, when I
click on the order button, instead of

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.510
uploading the order summary, it'll
actually send an intent to the maps app.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.250
The Google Maps app receives the intent
and then updates the map to show

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.270
the location that we
requested in the intent.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.700
Even if using these intents doesn't
make sense in the context of our coffee

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.795
ordering app, It's a good place
to practice creating intents.

00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:41.765
Let's undo this change and
then get back to our real tasks.

00:00:42.765 --> 00:00:44.645
In order to add this feature to our app,

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:48.495
we need to use an intent to send
the order summary to an email app.

00:00:48.495 --> 00:00:52.445
If you had no idea how to accomplish
this, you could do a web search.

00:00:52.445 --> 00:00:55.345
I did a search for email intent android.

00:00:55.345 --> 00:00:59.500
A bunch of useful links pop up like
a Stack Overflow post and a tutorial.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.550
But the common intents guide pops up and
says it's from the official

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.349
Android Documentation,
I'm going to click on that.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.870
In the side by here there's a link
on how to create an email intent,

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.560
so I'm going to click on that,
this shows you how to send

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.900
an intent to compose an email
with optional attachments.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.140
Looking through the documentation
there are two code examples.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.230
After reading this comment we
want this second code example.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.750
This is because we want our intent to
be handled only by an email app and

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.760
not by a text messaging or
social media app.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.550
Let's select this code and copy it,

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.390
and then we're going to
paste it into our app.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.520
Looking at the code for

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.505
our just Java app where should we
actually paste this code snippet?

00:01:38.505 --> 00:01:42.005
Well, we want to send the order
summary off to the email app

00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:44.695
as soon as we have
the complete order summary.

00:01:44.695 --> 00:01:48.175
And the place that we have the complete
order summary is after this line of code

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:49.965
here which creates the order summary and

00:01:49.965 --> 00:01:53.060
then stores it in a string
variable called priceMessage.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.880
So I'm going to add a new line here,
and then insert our code.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.420
Notice how we're creating
a new intent object

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.680
using the constructor with
the new keyword in java.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.090
We're passing in one argument
as input into the constructor

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.470
to initialize this intent object.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.710
The argument is this constant
called Intent.ACTION_SENDTO.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.510
Remember the convention is that when
you see something in all caps in Java

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.140
it means it's a constant.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.750
A constant is a variable who's contents
should never change once it's set.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.220
In this case when we're
creating our intent

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.370
we're using official intent action.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.460
ACTION_SENDTO which is defined as
a constant in the intent class.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.080
Then we call some methods on this
newly created intent object.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.650
We set the data to be
a URI of this format,

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.010
"mailto:", that way all the email
apps will handle this intent.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.120
Then we add some extra
data into the intent.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.700
We don't need to specify
the two field of this e-mail so

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.000
I'm just going to delete that line.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.800
We do, however, want to specify
the subject of the e-mail message.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.680
So I'm going to replace this
with actual subject line.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.440
Just Java order for, and
then add the persons name.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.950
Then these next couple of lines of
code check if there's an activity

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.140
on the device to handle this intent.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.980
If there is then it's safe
to send the intent and

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.400
recall start activity using this intent.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.330
If there's no activity on
the device to handle the intent,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.970
then we skip this block of code and
we skip sending the intent.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.900
Now, let's run the app on our device.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.890
Now when I click on the order button,

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.190
it sends an intent to
an email app on the device.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.060
By default, the Gmail app is
going to handle this intent.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.620
In a code since I specified a custom
subject line, it shows up here as just

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.900
Java order for Kaptain Kanal, which is
the name that I entered into the app.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.850
Now, the original quiz question asked
us to populate the email subject line,

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.490
as well as the message body
with the order summary.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.350
So let's go do that now.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.090
Looking back the the documentation for

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.330
the email intent, I'm going to scroll
up to look at the intent extras.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.520
We need to add an intent extra for

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.930
each additional piece of information
we want to provide about the email.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.709
For example, we could have an intent
extra about the recipients of the email

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.820
And we can have an Intent.EXTRA
about the subject line of the email.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.350
But this is what we really want.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.200
We want to add an Intent.EXTRA to
specify the body of the email.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.320
Again, Intent.EXTRA_TEXT is a constant
defined in the intent java class.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.050
If I click on it you'll
see more information.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.730
It's defined as a string
in the intent class.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.480
And the constant value is
this string right here.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.670
In the Just Java app when we create the
intent And we're going to populate this

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.540
extra, containing the body
of the email message.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.740
When the email app receives the intent,
they'll know to check for

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.410
this intent extra to find the body of
email and then they can populate that.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.440
Into the user interface.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.650
Let's make that code change now.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.540
I'm going to select this line of code,

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.440
that puts one extra into the intent for
the subject of the email.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.870
On the next line,
I'm going to paste the code.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.870
Now we're putting a second
extra into the intent.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:25.530
The extra is going to correspond
to Intent.EXTRA_TEXT so

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.810
that we know that it's for
the body of the email.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.360
The second argument to this
method is going to be the actual

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.490
body of the email.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.780
The body of the email should just
contain the order summary and

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.190
that's sorted in price message so I can
just copy this variable over to here.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:45.980
To recap, for

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.890
the intent object we're calling a method
putExtra to specific the email subject.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.890
In the same intent object we're
calling the put extra method again

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.720
to specify the body of the email.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.490
And the body of the email
is the order summary.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.670
Now let's run the app on our device.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.610
once I complete order,
I can click the button to submit.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.190
We send an intent to the email app
with the email subject populated and

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.270
the summary shows up now.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.380
Woo hoo!

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.110
For the third step of this task we're
going to remove the code that displays

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.760
the order summary in
the Just Java app because

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.070
now it's going to show
up in the email app.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.604
I'm going to start by modifying the
activity main layout to remove the order

00:06:26.604 --> 00:06:28.510
summary text views.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.360
At the bottom of the layout,
I'm going to delete the header

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.970
as well as the TextView that would
show the actual order summary.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.760
I'm going to save that and
switch to the Java file.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.276
In the main activity Java file, I no
longer need this display message method,

00:06:42.276 --> 00:06:46.463
which would update the order summary
text view because this view with this

00:06:46.463 --> 00:06:48.101
ID doesn't exist anymore.

00:06:52.323 --> 00:06:55.970
Since I deleted the display message
method, Android studio now gives me

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.870
an error saying that this method doesn't
exist, so I'm going to delete this.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.100
Looking back at our code, this makes
sense because when we click on the order

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.680
button, It's going to call
the submit order method,

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.610
we're going to do all this code, which
also sends an intent to the email app.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:16.030
There's no need to display the order
summary within our app any more.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.400
Let's verify that the app still works.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.090
When you delete large amounts of code,

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.710
it's easier to check
immediately that it works and

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.480
undo the changes if there's a mistake,
rather than trying to find it out later.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.890
And the app still works.

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:31.810
Nice job.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.880
You added an intent
to the just Java app.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.560
Intents are one of the core parts of
Android, but there are still many more

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.250
Android components that can
help you build better apps.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.570
I recommend that you check those out on
your own after you finish this course.
