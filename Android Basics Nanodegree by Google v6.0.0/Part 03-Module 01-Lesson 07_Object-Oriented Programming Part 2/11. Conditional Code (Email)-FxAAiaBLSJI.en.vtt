00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340
Assume that this a Code snippet from an InboxActivity.java file within an email app.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.610
Now, there's a lot of code here with concepts you haven't learned before.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.740
So, it's okay if you didn't get this one correct,

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.090
let's walk through it together.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.290
First, we create an integer variable called numberOfEmailsInInbox.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.065
We initialize the variable to have a value of zero.

00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:23.110
Then we create another integer variable called the numberOfDraftEmails,

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.800
and we initialize that to have a value of two.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.750
Next, we create a string variable called emailMessage, and the value is,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.550
"You have blank emails.",

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.240
where blank is actually a variable referring to a numberOfEmailsInInbox.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.105
So this evaluates to,

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:41.385
"You have zero emails",

00:00:41.385 --> 00:00:43.320
because this variable has a value of zero.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.785
Next, we have another string variable called draftMessage.

00:00:46.785 --> 00:00:50.970
The value is, "You have blank email drafts."

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.835
Blank actually refers to a number of draft emails,

00:00:53.835 --> 00:00:55.740
and this has a value of two.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.290
So this right hand side maps to,

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.495
"You have 2 email drafts."

00:01:00.495 --> 00:01:02.280
So far, we have four variables,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.560
and nothing has been printed to the logs yet.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.375
Now we have an 'if' statement.

00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:10.035
There is no Else block of code down here and that's perfectly fine.

00:01:10.035 --> 00:01:15.195
This statement reads, If the number of emails in inbox equals zero,

00:01:15.195 --> 00:01:18.875
then perform the code within these opening and closing braces.

00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:22.905
We remember that numberOfEmailsInInbox is equal to zero,

00:01:22.905 --> 00:01:27.810
so this code in the opening and closing braces would get executed.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.440
It simply updates the emailMessage variable to say,

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.075
"You have no new messages."

00:01:33.075 --> 00:01:37.380
Okay, so we know that the latest value of emailMessage is,

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.730
"You have no new messages",

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.970
and the latest value of draftMessage is up here,

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.605
"You have 2 email drafts."

00:01:43.605 --> 00:01:46.845
Let's continue reading. There's another 'if' statement down here.

00:01:46.845 --> 00:01:49.800
If the number of draftEmails equals zero,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.785
then perform the code within the opening and closing braces.

00:01:52.785 --> 00:01:56.595
However, number of draft emails has a value of two.

00:01:56.595 --> 00:02:00.030
That means this condition here is false,

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.355
and we can skip this block of code.

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:05.805
Therefore, the draftMessage variable stays at the value of,

00:02:05.805 --> 00:02:07.620
"You have 2 email drafts."

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.140
It does not update to this new message.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.025
Finally, we're back in the regular execution flow of the method.

00:02:14.025 --> 00:02:15.945
There's no more if statements,

00:02:15.945 --> 00:02:17.820
and we can run this line of code,

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.410
which prints to the logs.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.170
It prints the email message to the logs,

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.500
and then next, it prints the draftMessage to the logs.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.845
At this point in time, emailMessage says,

00:02:28.845 --> 00:02:30.420
"You have no new messages",

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.120
and draftMessage says, "You have 2 email drafts."

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.600
Looking at our choices,

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.650
option C is what we want.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.270
Option A is incorrect because we don't print out the message at every point in time.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.555
We only have two lines of code that print to the logs.

00:02:45.555 --> 00:02:47.145
Option B is incorrect,

00:02:47.145 --> 00:02:51.420
because the email message string gets updated within the 'if' statement,

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.560
and there's actually two email drafts not zero email drafts.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.140
So the second log statement is also incorrect.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.480
That leaves the remaining correct choice option C.
