00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.680
Invariably, you will land on a project
where you don't know much about

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.610
what's involved.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.880
It's completely okay to say, you know,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.540
I have not the slightest idea
how to solve this problem.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.250
This is very normal, and
it is normal for every single person.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.940
&gt;&gt; I remember still just,
just starting full time work.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.430
And realizing, wow, I'm not sure I
know how to work with big code bases.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.960
Or, I don't know this language,
and it's frightening.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.070
And there's a lot you don't know.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.950
Find a little nugget you can take on,
and take it from there.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.150
&gt;&gt; There's a lot of times when
you run into areas where you just

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.040
don't know what to do, and you feel like
you can't make it all come together.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.350
&gt;&gt; And the most important thing
is to not get caught up in that.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.840
Sometimes the best thing you can do is
actually just take a little time off of

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.630
a problem, and then circle back a little
bit later when you have a fresher mind,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.420
and then it'll be easy.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.320
&gt;&gt; Imposter syndrome is
the feeling that you're a fake.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.250
And somehow you snuck in, and
you don't deserve to be where you are.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.120
There are so many times at work,
where I get projects,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.570
to work on, and internally I feel like,
there's no way I can do this.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.010
I'm totally going to fail at it.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.010
The only person expecting
me to fail is myself.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.450
And so if I can get over that
I can gain more confidence and

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.670
do anything that I want to do.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.140
&gt;&gt; You have just asked me to code
up something or to fix a bug.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.320
I don't even know where to begin, the
best people I know learn to live with

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.340
uncertainty, fear, doubt, confusion,
and they just plow right ahead.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.540
&gt;&gt; Failure is
&gt;&gt; It's going to happen if you take

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.240
risks.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.650
And taking risks is
important to succeed.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.950
I have a few tips on
how to cope with that.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.340
Number one is try to see
the silver lining of failure.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.730
Number two is,
I think preparing is really important.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.080
It will help you a lot in
&gt;&gt; Taking the risks that

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.700
are more manageable and
being able to succeed more often.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.840
&gt;&gt; I think it's absolutely vital that
when you go into building something you

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.660
accept that sometimes
you're going to be wrong.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.370
If I had an opportunity to
sort of go back in time and

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.580
tell a younger version of myself,
just say I was getting started.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.930
What should I do?

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.740
I honestly think the main thing
would be to experiment more.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.860
And just always trying,
be learning new things.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.080
&gt;&gt; You don't have to have all
of the knowledge right now, but

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.370
just realize that you
can always learn it.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.780
And the whole coding process
is a learning process.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.875
&gt;&gt; So, if you're in a class, and it's
been a while, and you made progress,

00:02:37.875 --> 00:02:40.028
first of all be proud of that progress.

00:02:40.028 --> 00:02:47.280
And you find yourself now feeling
a little stuck, it's okay.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.130
Being overwhelmed is not a bad thing.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.250
That's my first advice.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.150
It means there's a lot of information
coming your way, and you're so

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.340
lucky that that is the case.
