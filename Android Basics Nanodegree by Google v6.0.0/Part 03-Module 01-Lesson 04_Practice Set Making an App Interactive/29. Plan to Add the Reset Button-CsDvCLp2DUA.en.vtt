00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
OK. You're doing a great job.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.785
And the functionality for the app is almost finished.

00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:06.870
We've got one more thing to add before styling

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.630
the app and that's adding the reset button.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.930
The functionality of the reset button is this.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.065
So, I can start making a score.

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:18.800
Let's say that the teams have some points.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.770
When the game ends, you can hit

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.415
the reset button and both of the scores will go back to zero.

00:00:24.415 --> 00:00:28.260
You can then add more points and they'll add from zero.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.565
Before you start coding, I want you to plan out what you're going to do in pseudocode.

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:34.780
Here's a space for you to do that.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.110
To make this a little bit more challenging and true to real life,

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.785
I'm actually not going to tell you the pseudocode that I would use after this.

00:00:41.785 --> 00:00:47.430
Instead, you'll jump right into transforming your pseudocode into your actual Java code.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.620
OK. So write your thoughts here.
