00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
All right. Hopefully, this wasn't too tricky.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.365
This is actually a very similar situation to the udacicolaVotes.

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:10.200
pepcityVotes was also made a local variable,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.735
and similarly, its scope is limited to just the votePepcity method.

00:00:14.735 --> 00:00:18.180
Meaning that, it gets created here and then in

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.885
this next line after adding one to its value, it gets trashed.

00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:25.500
Now something you might have noticed is how pepcityVotes doesn't

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.925
have the initialization to zero that udacicolaVotes does.

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:31.980
This is actually a pretty big error,

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.125
and will cause your code to not be able to compile.

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:36.135
Meaning, it won't be able to run on the phone.

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:38.785
Local variables must be initialized.

00:00:38.785 --> 00:00:40.520
Meaning, that they must be given some sort of

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.355
initial value like we're doing here with the udacicolaVotes.

00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:47.300
Then we have the same problems that we had with the udacicola between button clicks.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.050
It's not actually really counting up how many votes that pepcity has,

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.900
and when we do the show me votes method,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.670
because the scope ends here,

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.910
you actually won't be able to use the variable value down here.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.540
So if you said that this has the same problems as udacicolaVotes does, you'd be correct.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.600
Okay. Let's look at another problem.
