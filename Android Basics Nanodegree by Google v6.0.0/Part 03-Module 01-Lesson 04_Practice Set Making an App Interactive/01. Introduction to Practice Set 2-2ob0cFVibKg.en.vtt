00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.200
Okay, you're about to do some shorter
warm-up problems before we code an app.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.110
While you're working on these problems,
you might want to copy over code

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.820
examples into an application and
actually try running it.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.570
Now you might be thinking
about putting this sort of

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.320
random Java code that you're testing
out into your Just Java app, but

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.240
this could get a little bit messy.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.800
So instead of potentially
messing up your Just Java app,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.670
I humbly suggest making a new app.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.720
Okay, so you'll want to click on the
Start a new Android Studio project, and

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.800
then you can use these specs
to create your new project.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.100
If you get stuck,
you can watch the solution video, or

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.680
I'll quickly get up and run it.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.800
If you want a slower moving video,
I've provided a link to the video from

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.860
practice set one, where you set
up the happy birthday project.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.530
All right, get to it.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.100
Don't worry, I'll wait for you.
