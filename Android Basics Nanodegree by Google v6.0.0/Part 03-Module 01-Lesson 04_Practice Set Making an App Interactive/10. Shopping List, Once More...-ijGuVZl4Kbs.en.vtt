00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
Okay, this problem's goal is exactly the same as the last one.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.915
So, really it's just the code that's changed and let's see what's different.

00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:08.640
To start off with their heads simulation,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.800
we're initializing and declaring a variable

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.440
here called raspberryPrice, and we're setting it to five.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.160
And this next line here is the first time we're displaying something,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.675
and we're saying 1 box dollar sign,

00:00:20.675 --> 00:00:23.650
and then whatever the current value of raspberryPrice is,

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.075
which right now is five.

00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:28.115
So this is going to print out one box $5.

00:00:28.115 --> 00:00:31.855
Seems pretty good. Now, in the next line things change up a little bit.

00:00:31.855 --> 00:00:35.410
We're taking raspberryPrice and we're changing its value to ten.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.530
Note, that doesn't change what gets displayed here,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.420
this is already displaying one box $5.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.245
In area two, we're saying two boxes dollar sign,

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:48.235
and then the current value of raspberryPrice, which is ten.

00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:51.680
So, two boxes $10, looks good.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.320
Now we move to the next line,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.345
which is going to be displaying in text box three,

00:00:55.345 --> 00:00:57.680
it says three boxes dollar sign,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.800
and then raspberryPrice, which is currently ten times three,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.345
which would make this 30.

00:01:03.345 --> 00:01:09.075
That's a little bit problematic because now we're saying three boxes is $30,

00:01:09.075 --> 00:01:10.980
where it should be $15.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.640
So, we see this difference arise because unlike the previous example,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.140
we are changing the value of raspberryPrice in the middle of the program,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.880
and hence, simulating sort of helped us see this.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.640
This is an example where it's so important to keep

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.410
track of your instructions and exactly what's going on.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.390
If we didn't really record the fact that the variable had changed to ten,

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.250
we wouldn't have seen the error here.
