00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
Okay. Let's look at each of these.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.795
So, here we have a type and here we have a name.

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:06.615
But we don't put a space, we put a dash here.

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:11.970
And honestly, that's really no different than just writing something like, stringname.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.210
Java won't be able to see these as separate words and it will cause an error,

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.210
because it thinks you're trying to declare a variable without giving it a type.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.970
Oops! And apparently we also forgot a semicolon, that's not good.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.875
So, this is what the problem is.

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:25.720
Okay, let's look at the next one.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.525
String is a correct data type, so that's all good.

00:00:28.525 --> 00:00:30.865
But over here the variable name,

00:00:30.865 --> 00:00:33.205
we're breaking a variable naming rule.

00:00:33.205 --> 00:00:37.250
Variable names really can't contain miscellaneous punctuation like these quotes here.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.110
Whoever just declared this variable might be confusing the variable name,

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.585
which is just to type word, with a value,

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:46.345
which is a string and must be surrounded by quotes.

00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:49.825
So, variable names can't have weird punctuation with them.

00:00:49.825 --> 00:00:52.240
Strings require you to surround them by quotes.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.365
Okay. And this last one,

00:00:53.365 --> 00:00:55.240
the datatype looks correct.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.570
And now we have name on profile.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.810
Well, this is actually breaking one of the variable naming rules,

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.900
which is that in your variable name you can't have spaces.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.140
Java is basically going to see the word name and expect to have

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.380
some sort of initialization off of it or a semicolon or something,

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.350
and won't expect for the name to continue after there's a space.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.670
So, how do we solve this?

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.530
Well, usually if you want a name like this,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.255
we just write it in CamelCase.

00:01:18.255 --> 00:01:20.010
So, you could write something out like,

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.410
nameOnProfile with the O and P being capitalized and no spaces in between.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.675
And this is a great variable name

00:01:27.675 --> 00:01:30.120
especially if you want to be able to include all of these words.
