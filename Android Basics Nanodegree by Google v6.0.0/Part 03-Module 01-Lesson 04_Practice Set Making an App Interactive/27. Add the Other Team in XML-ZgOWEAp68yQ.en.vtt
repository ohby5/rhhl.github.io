00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.100
Okay.
You're doing a great job.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.620
And your app is looking pretty good.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.340
Unfortunately, right now,
it only really works for

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.150
a pretty one sided basketball game.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.950
What we really want is for it to be
able to keep score for two teams.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.600
Let's start with the xml, and
then we can worry about the Java.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.400
Okay.
So you're going to be adding another

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.080
column for team b.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.380
And remember we're just
focusing on the XML right now.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.770
If we remember the design for
this first side.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.200
It's a stack of views all within
a vertical linear lay out.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.310
Now the side for
team B looks pretty darn similar.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.280
Try as we might though,
you can't have two root views.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.220
So you're going to need to use
nested lay outs in this case.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.070
You should be thinking of each
of these linear lay outs,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.759
kind of like a view in itself.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.320
So if we think of this all as just one
view, and this all as just one view.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.780
And if each of these two views need
to take up equal amount of space, so

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.630
basically half of the screen.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.560
What parent view group
would we need to use?

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.970
Put your answer to that here.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.560
Now, once you've got this right,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.170
hopefully that will give you enough
information to start coding this out.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.400
Give it a try, you can always watch
the solution video if you get really,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.000
really stuck.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.010
Now, once you've coded it up,
it should look like this.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.430
So, Team A, well that side
should still function okay.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.400
Team B though, might have well,
a bit strange behavior.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.850
That's because we haven't really
coded up the Java for that side.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.720
So don't worry about it,
just try to get it to look like this.
