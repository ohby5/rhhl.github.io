00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.140
So, we've talked in detail about what
the PseudoCode for this looks like.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.120
So, now what I want you to do is
translate the PseudoCode to code code

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.120
and add that to your app.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.440
So, to be a little bit more explicit,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.460
these are the instructions that
we've written out in PseudoCode.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.550
And, you've actually already transformed
this PseudoCode into code code.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.190
This is roughly equivalent to
Setting the onClick method for

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.650
the 3 Points button to relate
to the addThreeForTeamA method.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.620
And then, coding in the Java code
the addThreeForTeamA method.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.940
You've already done this.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.610
Now, what you need to do is translate
these other two lines of PseudoCode into

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.490
code code.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.300
And then, add them to your app.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.150
You could go ahead and
type them here first,

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.080
if you'd like,
to see if they're correct.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.100
Or, you could add them in your app
first,and then paste them back here,

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.400
to certify that you've
done them correctly.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.090
Whichever you prefer.
