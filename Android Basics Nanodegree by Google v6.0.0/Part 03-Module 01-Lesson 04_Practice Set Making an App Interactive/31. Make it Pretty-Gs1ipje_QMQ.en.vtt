00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
Right now, our app has all the functionality that it needs.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.100
It just doesn't look very pretty.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.310
So, I'm going to be walking you through how to make those changes.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.900
So, the first thing we're going to do is modify something called the styles file,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.585
and that's located in Values.

00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:18.555
And then it's right here, this styles.xml.

00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:20.355
So, I'm going to double click.

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:23.129
Now, this is a file that you've never really touched before,

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:25.935
and I'm not going to go into the details of exactly how this works.

00:00:25.935 --> 00:00:27.660
We've provided you with some code,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.370
which will change your buttons to orange,

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.410
and also change your action bar to orange.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.820
And this code will do that,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.100
because the styles file is responsible for

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.920
controlling the basic default styles of your app.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.390
Whereas right now in our xml,

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.100
if you wanted to change the color of the background,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.140
we would do it for each element.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.780
But if you do to the styles file,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.190
it'll do it for the entire layout.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.550
So, I'm going to paste the code that I gave you over.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.600
This color primary here is the color that the action bar will be,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.670
and this colorButtonNormal is the color that your buttons will be. Now, a quick note.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.305
Because of API updates,

00:01:01.305 --> 00:01:06.930
this colorButtonNormal tag will actually only work if you have API level 22 and above.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.650
So what this means is that, if you have a newer phone,

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.460
you will see the orange buttons,

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.305
and you can check it out of the emulator.

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:15.105
If your phone is a little bit older,

00:01:15.105 --> 00:01:16.530
you'll still see grey buttons.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.195
Now, there are ways to get around this,

00:01:18.195 --> 00:01:21.605
but I don't want us to get too caught up in the weeds of how to color our buttons.

00:01:21.605 --> 00:01:24.360
Okay, let's go back to our activity_main.xml.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.540
Okay, cool, so, we can see now that it actually

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.440
updated to show that our buttons are orange and our action bar is also orange.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.200
Our status bar also became a light grey,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.020
which is due to us changing this parent attribute right here,

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.290
to AppCompact.Light instead of AppCompact.Dark.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.275
It gave us a light theming instead of a dark theming.

00:01:43.275 --> 00:01:45.240
Okay, let me go back to the xml.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.605
So, the next thing on our list is to make a nice little divider bar right here.

00:01:49.605 --> 00:01:52.710
So, if I click on this linear layout right here,

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.785
we can see that it's this view that lives here.

00:01:55.785 --> 00:01:58.335
If I scroll down a little bit,

00:01:58.335 --> 00:02:01.785
I'll see the other linear layout when I click on it.

00:02:01.785 --> 00:02:04.230
Is this linear layout right here.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.890
So, if I wanted a bar in between the two,

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.345
I would put it right here,

00:02:09.345 --> 00:02:11.900
after which the first linear layout closes,

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.860
and before the second linear layout opens.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.425
And because the parents of both of these two linear layout is another linear layout,

00:02:19.425 --> 00:02:21.360
I'll scroll up to show you,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.090
this linear layout right here,

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.940
which has an orientation of horizontal.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.040
When I put the bar right here,

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.200
it's going to show this linear layout,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.420
then the bar, then this linear layout,

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.680
all in a horizontal row.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.005
Let me go down.

00:02:37.005 --> 00:02:39.750
If you just want to make a colored square,

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.605
which is essentially what a line is that runs down the center here,

00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:45.930
we can use a view called, View.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.710
Now, just like other views,

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.905
this view needs a width and a height.

00:02:50.905 --> 00:02:52.530
Now, we want a thin line.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.680
So, the width of this View should be 1dp.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.785
This is what the thickness of the line is going to be.

00:02:58.785 --> 00:03:02.490
And what I want is for this line to be just as tall as all the text and

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.870
the buttons in the linear layout for Team A and the linear layout for Team B.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.600
So, I'm going to make the height match parent.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.845
Now, this view is basically a box that has 1dp in width and has the height of the parent,

00:03:16.845 --> 00:03:18.510
linearly out of all of this.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.660
But we can't see it because the background color is white.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.050
So, I'm going to change the background color to dark grey.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.435
So, now we have a dark gray line that's going down the center of the screen.

00:03:30.435 --> 00:03:32.770
But if we zoom in,

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:39.390
we'll see that it's actually going down the entire center of the screen,

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.800
even through the Reset button and we actually want it to stop right about here.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.710
So, the way that we're going to do that,

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.765
is we're going to start telling things to wrap content instead of match parent.

00:03:51.765 --> 00:03:55.425
Specifically for the Team A and Team B linear layouts,

00:03:55.425 --> 00:03:57.780
instead of having their height be the entire screen,

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.690
we're going to have it wrap content for both of these,

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.750
so that the Layouts will end right at the bottom of the buttons.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.360
And then, for the parent layout,

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.415
the horizontal layout that's laying out all this,

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.185
we'll also tell it to wrap content,

00:04:10.185 --> 00:04:12.885
which will wrap the content uptight against

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:16.110
the bottom of the Team B and Team A linear layouts.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.470
And that should make the line the same height as both of these layouts.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.000
So, let's make those changes.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.205
Let's start with this linear layout right here,

00:04:23.205 --> 00:04:25.155
which is the linear layout for Team B,

00:04:25.155 --> 00:04:28.275
and I'm going to change its height to wrap content.

00:04:28.275 --> 00:04:31.720
Good. It's wrapping the content of the buttons right now.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.255
I'm going to click on the Team A layout and I'm also going to change its layout height,

00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:39.615
instead of match parent, to wrap content.

00:04:39.615 --> 00:04:41.760
So, now both of these layouts here,

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.435
are wrapping the content of their children.

00:04:45.435 --> 00:04:48.300
But the line down the middle is still extended towards the bottom,

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.560
and that's because the parent of

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.080
these two linear layouts is still taking up all the space,

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.970
because it has a height of match parent,

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.230
which is the entire screen.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.340
So, now, I'm going to tell this as well to wrap content.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.925
So, now, the gray line ends here at the bottom of both of these linear layouts.

00:05:04.925 --> 00:05:08.960
Cool. Now, I didn't want the gray line to extend all the way up here,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.140
but that's an issue that can be resolved with padding and layout margin,

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.645
so, we'll do that in a little bit.

00:05:13.645 --> 00:05:17.780
Now, what I want to do is go through and get all the appropriate text sizes,

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.490
colors, and the correct fonts.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.865
So, we're going to just start at the top and make those changes.

00:05:22.865 --> 00:05:24.910
What I've been told for this first text field,

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:31.420
is that it's going to have a font family of sans-serif-medium.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.175
And it's going to have a text size of 14sp.

00:05:34.175 --> 00:05:39.500
And finally also that it's text color is going to be the hex code 616161,

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.985
which is a nice light gray text color.

00:05:42.985 --> 00:05:44.940
So, that's the font, the size,

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.975
and the color for this Team A text view.

00:05:46.975 --> 00:05:50.255
I'm going to move on to the Team A score.

00:05:50.255 --> 00:05:54.965
Now, for the score, the font family is going to be sans-serif-light,

00:05:54.965 --> 00:06:00.005
the text size is going to be a large 56sp,

00:06:00.005 --> 00:06:02.210
so that our score is nice and big.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.224
And the text color is actually going to be black,

00:06:06.224 --> 00:06:10.840
which in Hex is represented as 000000.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.320
Cool. I'm going to zoom out.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.370
So, for our buttons, we actually don't change anything about

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.340
the text styling or text size or text color. These are fine.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.380
But I do want to change the other side,

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.660
and I change it exactly as I change the first side.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.840
So, let me do that really quickly.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.765
So, it just updated, so that these two are exactly the same now,

00:06:29.765 --> 00:06:31.760
and our text sizes, colors,

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.530
and font families are looking pretty good.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.385
So, really the only thing left is to work on the spacing issues that I'm seeing.

00:06:37.385 --> 00:06:40.070
We'll start with the first TextView here.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.585
Instead of a padding of a 4dp,

00:06:42.585 --> 00:06:45.270
we're going to change it to a padding of 16dp.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.834
Now, here in the score TextView,

00:06:47.834 --> 00:06:49.890
instead of a padding of 4dp,

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.380
we're going to change it to padding bottom of 24dp.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.015
And that's because with the 16dp padding here

00:06:56.015 --> 00:06:59.150
we already have enough room between these two lines of text.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.005
Now, for the buttons. Now, our buttons are looking a little bit wide.

00:07:04.005 --> 00:07:06.140
I don't want to give them a specific width,

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.260
but I do want them to be a little bit farther away from the edges.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.330
Now, we can't use padding, because remember,

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.850
padding is space added inside the view,

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.665
and button views have a background color that extends throughout the view.

00:07:17.665 --> 00:07:19.895
So, we're going to be using margin here.

00:07:19.895 --> 00:07:22.510
Now, right now I have a layout margin of eight.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.470
But what I'm going to do, is change this to

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:29.399
a layout margin bottom of eight and then a margin left and right of 24,

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:33.090
which will keep the same spacing vertically,

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:34.905
but will push in the sides of the button.

00:07:34.905 --> 00:07:36.750
So, let's do that now.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.160
So, that button's looking a little bit better.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.005
I'm going to do the same thing to the other two buttons here.

00:07:42.005 --> 00:07:45.140
And I'm actually copying and pasting to do this.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.840
All right, cool. Now, I don't want to bore you so,

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.995
I'm just going to make the same changes to this side that I just made to Team A,

00:07:50.995 --> 00:07:52.655
so give me one second.

00:07:52.655 --> 00:07:55.055
Great. Now, my two sides look the same.

00:07:55.055 --> 00:07:57.860
The only other real margin that I have to deal with is the margin

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.725
for this gray line here and the margin for the Reset button.

00:08:00.725 --> 00:08:03.100
Well let's do the Reset button first.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:07.260
So, I'm going to get the reset button a bottom margin of 8dp,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.240
and I'm going to give it a left and right margin of 22dp.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.195
Now, I'm going to scroll up to the gray line.

00:08:14.195 --> 00:08:16.320
That's this view right here.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.045
And basically, I don't want the gray line to be touching the app bar right here.

00:08:20.045 --> 00:08:21.710
I want to give in a little bit of space.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.110
And I'm going to be using margin

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.855
instead of padding for the same reasons that I did on the button,

00:08:26.855 --> 00:08:28.430
because this has a great background,

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:32.660
so any padding that I use actually is not going to really change anything.

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.570
But margin, which is space around the view, will.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.115
So, let's do that right now.

00:08:37.115 --> 00:08:41.610
MarginTop and we'll do 16dp.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.210
There we go, there's little space above the gray line there.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.940
Now, my codes are looking a little bit

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.060
sloppy because I was just adding attributes willy nilly.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.780
So, I'm going to do a command+A,

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:55.670
or if you're on a Windows device a control+A to select all.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.960
And then I'm going to do a command option+L,

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.200
and if you're on a Windows device that's a control+alt+L.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.420
And that will automatically reformat the code for me,

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.965
it will look really nice and pretty,

00:09:06.965 --> 00:09:09.700
just as pretty as our new Court Counter app.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.440
Now, I kind of want to see this on my phone.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.315
So, I'm going to load up my phone right now with this newly skid app.

00:09:14.315 --> 00:09:16.445
Remember, if you have an older phone,

00:09:16.445 --> 00:09:18.290
it's going to show the buttons as a different color.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.905
But you can always use the emulator.

00:09:20.905 --> 00:09:23.720
What a stylish looking app.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.270
Now, the question is, is it still working?

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:29.425
Well, I didn't touch any of the Java code, so, yes.

00:09:29.425 --> 00:09:31.610
And the scores are nice and big now and I got

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.650
these wonderful colors for my buttons. Awesome work.
