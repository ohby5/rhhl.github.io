00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.130
You're going to start by practicing
identifying errors when creating

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:03.670
new variables.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.490
Now if you want to use some technical
verbage, what your actually doing is

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.380
finding errors with declaring and
initializing variables.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.940
Declaring your variable means
creating a new variable.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.100
It's like making the box for
a variable, and it looks like this.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.020
Right now, there's no value involved,
it's just the data type, the name,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.580
and a semi colon.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.830
Initializing on the other hand, is when
you set an initial value for a variable.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.640
It's that act of putting
something inside the box.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.400
And in code it looks like this.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.820
Total = 10.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.460
Now oftentimes you'll combine the two,
both declaring and initializing and

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.760
write a code statement
like int total =10.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.160
This both creates the box and

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.750
puts the value inside
the box all in one statement.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.100
So you're going to be looking
at statements like these,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.580
which either are both a declaration and
an initialization or

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.780
just a declaration and
identifying when an error has been made.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.990
Now, these errors are bad enough that
they're considered compile time errors.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.360
And what this means is that Android
Studio won't even let you run your code,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.700
because it can't understand
what you're trying to say.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.770
Let's take a look at an example
of what the Part 1 problems

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:03.450
are going to look like.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.030
Okay, so this is the first
of the Part 1 problems,

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.130
and I'm just going to walk
you through it a little bit.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.400
Okay, so the problem states,
unreadEemails is a variable storing

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.120
the number of unread emails for
an inbox app.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.780
And we're going to go ahead and
assume that there are ten unread emails.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.285
So now you're going to look
at these three different

00:01:21.285 --> 00:01:23.960
initializations/declarations.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.020
Some or all of these will have errors.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.120
You're just looking at
the single line by itself.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.500
This is not a block of code.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.620
So you'll look at the first one and
decide whether it's properly written

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.660
in a way that it both declares and
initializes the variable unreadEmails.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.100
If it does move on to the next one.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.260
And if you don't think it does then put
a check right here in this check box.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.690
Now if it has an error I also
want you to come over here and

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.680
describe what you think
is causing the error.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.860
Okay but i'm not necessarily saying
this one has an error that was just for

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.850
an example.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.940
Okay, so you'd go through these and

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.800
check the ones that you
think have problems and

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.710
then describe what the errors are here.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.470
If you'd like,
I've provided the code for

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.540
each of these exercises in
the instructor notes below.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.000
So you can try copying them over,
one at a time, and

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.729
putting them into the app that
you just created for yourself.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.990
Once you're done, I highly encourage
you to go through the solution video.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.170
I'll explain the logic behind
which ones had errors.
