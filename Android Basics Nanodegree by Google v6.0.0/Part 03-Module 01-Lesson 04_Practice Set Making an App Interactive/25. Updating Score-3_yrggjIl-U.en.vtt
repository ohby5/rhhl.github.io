00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.800
Okay, so let's figure out what these
two steps would look like in code.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.040
So the first one is you're taking the
score for team A and you're changing it.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.100
And I'm just going to say
changing it for now, and

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.560
we'll figure out what we
change it to in a second.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.309
You'd have this variable.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.520
And whenever you want to change
the value of this variable,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.020
you need to use the assignment operator.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.260
And then you can figure out
what you're changing it to.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.560
Well, you're increasing it by 3.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.207
Which means that you're taking whatever
is currently in Score Team A and

00:00:31.207 --> 00:00:32.800
adding 3 to it.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.060
So two things are analogous.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.400
Increasing by 3 and
taking the current value and adding 3.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.710
So, if we take the current value and

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.936
we could get that by just writing
the name of the variable.

00:00:44.936 --> 00:00:48.585
Addition symbol and 3.

00:00:48.585 --> 00:00:52.385
We are increasing the current
value of Score Team A by 3.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:55.415
And of course, end with a semicolon.

00:00:56.465 --> 00:01:00.630
Now I'm not putting an INT here because
this variable has already been declared.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.550
We did that a few videos ago.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.040
It'll be more clear when
we look at the code.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.560
Anyways for
now let's quickly do this next step.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.280
So to display the score I need to use
the display method that I copied over.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.970
So before I was just
telling it to display 3.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.140
But I don't want to
display the number 3.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.180
I want to display whatever
value is in Score Team A.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.290
So what I actually should
put here is Score Team A.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.510
Okay, and I don't want to forget
my parenthesis or my semi-colon.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.930
All right, let's put this in the code
and make sure that everything works.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.530
So here I am in my java code.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.840
And I'm going to go scroll down
to this addThree forTeamA method,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.310
because this is the code that happens
whenever I press the plus three button.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.820
All right, I'm going to remove this for
now because this is old code.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.900
And I'm going to perform my two steps.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.010
The first one was to take
the variable scoreTeamA and

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:07.250
set it equal to its old value plus 3.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.139
Okay, this is the increase
by three step.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:14.540
And then the second step after
that is to display it and

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.472
when I say it,
I mean the variable score, Team A.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:22.800
Okay, so there are my two steps.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.620
Okay, moment of truth,
let's hit plus 3 points.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.225
Okay, it increased to 3.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.360
It's kind of small but it increased
to 6, 9, 12, 15, okay, awesome.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.040
This seems to be working.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.890
Now, these other ones don't work,
but we didn't expect them to.
