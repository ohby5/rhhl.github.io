00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.640
Okay, so here is our picture
of our court counter app, or

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.820
at least how we want it to look.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.120
Now, I'm going to follow my own
advice and start with the XML first.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.640
Let's think about the view
situation right now.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.540
So, we still have all these views,
and these views are in vertical and

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.720
linear layouts.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.270
We have a linear layout for team B and
a linear layout for team A.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.574
and you can't just have two
root views so furthermore,

00:00:26.574 --> 00:00:30.793
these are wrapped in a linear layout,
which happens to be horizontal so

00:00:30.793 --> 00:00:35.200
that these two child linear layouts
can be next to one another.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.230
Okay, now we want to add
a reset button down here.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.920
For the sake of your brain not
exploding thinking about all these

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.800
different layouts, I want you to
think of everything inside of this

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.460
horizontal linear layout
kind of like a single view.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.910
And now you're just trying to lay out
this horizontal linear layout right here

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.910
and this reset button.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.850
You're trying to lay out two views.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.570
One view is at the top and the other
view is at the bottom of the screen.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.680
So the question now is what view
group would allow you to have

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.800
a view up here at the top and
a view down by the bottom of the screen?

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.450
And it turns out that a relative layout
is a pretty good candidate for this.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.310
I can have my horizontal linear
layout here, match the parent for

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.560
the width, and
then wrap content for the height.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.490
And I can have my reset button right
here, align with the center and

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.060
bottom of the pairing.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.510
Okay, so you have a Relative Layout, and

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.340
that Relative Layout has a Button
child and a Linear Layout child.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.120
And the Button child is
this Reset button, and

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.430
the Linear Layout is the Linear Layout
here, the horizontal one.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.060
Furthermore, this horizontal linear
layout has two children, and

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.810
those children are also linear layouts.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.870
They are the linear layout for
team A and the linear layout for

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.670
team B that you see here.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.280
The linear layout for team A has
two text views and three buttons.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.170
The same is true of this
linear layout for team B.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.160
Five children, two text views,
and three buttons.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.260
This portion of the layout
you've already made,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.770
you just need to add this,
all right, let's do it.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.035
Okay, I'm here in my XML code and so the
first thing I'm going to do is is I'm

00:02:13.035 --> 00:02:18.010
going to make the Root Relative Layout
that you saw in the diagram.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.580
So here going to type RelativeLayout,
and I actually want

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.440
to cut and paste these two lines because
they need to be in the root layout.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.920
So I'm cutting them and I'm pasting
them here, in my root layout.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.260
Okay, now I'm going to close
off my RelativeLayout here and

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.500
I'm going to move this closing
tag all the way to the bottom.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.470
Okay, so what I essentially have right
now Is this part of the diagram.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.610
All right,
looks like I have some errors as well.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.210
Let's see, yes, I haven't defined
a height or a width, so let's do that.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.250
Now my relative layout had the button
at the bottom center of the screen.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.260
So, to do that, it's probably going to
need to fill the whole screen.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.960
So I'm going to do
match parents on both.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.530
Okay, now I need to add the button.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.587
I'm going to scroll down, right here,
to where the linear layout closes,

00:03:17.587 --> 00:03:23.462
but I still am inside the relative
layout, and I'm going to add a button.

00:03:23.462 --> 00:03:26.664
And I'm going to go ahead and
wrap content for that button,

00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:30.398
because it's not a button that
expands to fill the entire bottom of

00:03:30.398 --> 00:03:33.150
the screen or
expands to fill the entire screen.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.640
And now the parent of this button
is the RelativeLayout, and

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.370
we're going to set the text
of this button to Reset.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.390
Let's see what this looks like.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.960
Okay so my reset button's up here,
that's not exactly where I want it to

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.730
be, but it's parent is relatively out,
that fills up the entire screen.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.240
So I can align it to the parent.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.450
I want to align it to
the parents bottom, and

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.170
I want it to be in the center of
the parent, horizontally anyways.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.150
Cool, my button seems to
be in the right place.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.270
I'm going to select everything here.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.560
And I'm going to do
a command option L on Mac.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.490
Which is the same thing as Control-Alt-L
on Windows to just reformat the code and

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.890
get it to look nice.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.690
Okay let's go back to our Java code.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.190
Now I've got my button but
it's not doing anything.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.690
Let's start by making a method for it.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.250
I'm going to make this right above
the display methods, here, public void.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.100
I'm going to call this
method resetScore,

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.180
because that's what I intend for
it to do.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.860
Scroll up, I'm going to make
it match these other methods

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.670
with the View v, and then, curly braces.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.100
I won't worry about what's
going to go in here for now.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.200
I'm going to go back to my XML code And

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.200
I'm going to do the second part of
the hooking the button to the Java code

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.970
by adding a onClick attribute here for
resetScore.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.310
Okay, so now when I click this button
the code here will be run, but

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.110
there isn't any code here.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.290
Let's figure out what I need to add.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.750
Okay, let's go back to this
discussion of pseudoCode.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.340
When I hit the Reset button,
what do I want to happen?

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.950
Well, I want both of these
two scores to show 0.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.130
Furthermore, I want the variables for
score team A and for

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.740
score team B to go back to zero.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.330
Remember, when I click on any of
these buttons, I'm adding two and

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.060
then displaying the variable.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.820
So, if I don't put
the variable back to zero,

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.160
it's going to show an incorrect number.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.300
So here’s what I came up
with pseudoCode-wise.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.380
The first thing I want to do is
set the score for Team A to zero.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.440
Then I want to do the same thing for
Team B.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.260
Now both of the scores are zero, but
nothing's been displayed yet, which is

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.570
why in Step 3 I'll display the score for
Team A, which has been set to zero.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.185
And to be a little bit more specific,
I’m going to display the score for

00:06:00.185 --> 00:06:04.091
Team A here, and then I'll display
the score for Team B here.

00:06:04.091 --> 00:06:07.610
And because in Steps 1 and 2,
I've ensured that they're set to zero,

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.230
they will display zero here and here.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.400
Then when I click any of these
buttons to update ScoreForTeamA or

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.389
ScoreForTeamB, it's going to be updating
but starting with a score of zero.

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:23.984
Okay, so in reset score I'm going to
type my pseudo code as code, code.

00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:28.952
So the first thing I'm going to do is
take score A and set it's value to

00:06:28.952 --> 00:06:34.010
zero using a assignment operator
here and the value of zero.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.800
Oh and
don't forget the semi colon of course.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.550
I'll do the same for score B.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:48.515
After that, I'm going to display in
the team A spot, the score for team A.

00:06:48.515 --> 00:06:53.150
And then I'm going to display in
the team B spot, the score for team B.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.289
I'll also go ahead here and
add a comment.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.080
Okay, this all seems reasonable.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.750
And it's been a while since I've
run anything on my phone, so

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.587
I'm going to press the Run button,
okay, cool.

00:07:06.587 --> 00:07:08.000
I have a RESET button.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.997
Let's see if it works.

00:07:13.339 --> 00:07:14.732
Good, it sets to zero.

00:07:14.732 --> 00:07:16.500
Let's click a little bit more,

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.457
just to make sure that
everything's still working.

00:07:23.961 --> 00:07:28.338
Cool, and it looks like it is, awesome.

00:07:28.338 --> 00:07:30.270
Now this was a little
bit of a tricky one.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.720
So let me show you what happens if
you were to switch around the order,

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.050
do something a little bit differently.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.890
What if I switch these two around?

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.809
Well, let's just see what happens.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.710
Okay, so here it is,
let's see what it does.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.660
Okay, so I'm going to add some points.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:53.080
Now for the moment of truth,
Reset button.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.850
Huh, doesn't seem to do anything.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.090
Let's try clicking, huh, interesting.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:00.520
Well it's kind of hard to see,

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.470
but the score before said 19,
I hit the reset button nothing changed.

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.650
But then when I hit free
throw it showed one.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:12.500
let's try with the other side,
if I hit plus two points.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.220
Oh, it shows two.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.600
let's look at the code again for
why that might be the case.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.490
So I switched around displaying and
setting the score.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.870
Just to see what kind of error
behavior I might get from that.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:29.732
Let's say TeamA has a score of 30 and
TeamB has a score of 40.

00:08:29.732 --> 00:08:33.049
When I say displayForTeamA
it's going to show 30 and

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:37.230
when I say displayForTeamB
it's going to show 40.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:41.490
Only after that, will it actually
set these values to zero.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:45.730
But since it displayed first it's not
going to show the values of zero.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.440
But the variable will be zero.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:53.430
So when I press something like
addThreeForTeamB, it's going to take

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:59.960
the value of zero that I set down here,
add three, and then display three.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:06.490
So to us, it would look like TeamB
went from having a score of 30 then to

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:11.630
after clicking the reset button, a score
of three, which is kind of a weird jump.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:15.490
Now one way I could fix this besides
swapping it back to how it should be

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:19.370
Is I could put display zero here.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:22.390
And you can test this out on your own,
but this would actually work.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:24.200
It's just a little bit counterintuitive.

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:29.080
I like showing examples like this
because it kind of shows the beauty and

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.800
subjectivity of code.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.360
Now, in this case, I happen to think
fairly strongly that the first way that

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.290
I had the code was better.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.130
But you might start seeing scenarios
where there could be two different

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.880
ways to write the code, and
both of them are technically correct.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.430
Since there isn't always
one right answer,

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:49.140
you shouldn't feel constricted
to do it the exact correct way.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.600
Try coding up something that works
your way, see how other people do it,

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.640
and then compare, who's more efficient,
whose code is clearer.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.770
These kind of discussions could be
a really helpful learning experience.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:04.030
Okay, but I'm going to revert the code
back to the state that it was before

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.390
which was working and

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:09.660
now I have all the functionality of my
app but it's not pretty, let's fix that.
