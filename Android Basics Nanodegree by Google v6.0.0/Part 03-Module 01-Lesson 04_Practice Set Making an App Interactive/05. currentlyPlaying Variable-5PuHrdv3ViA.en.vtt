00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.505
Okay, let's look at these guys.

00:00:02.505 --> 00:00:06.600
Now remember, these aren't instructions that are meant to be followed together.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.095
There are different ways that you can instantiate or declare currently playing.

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:12.870
So let's look at each of them separately.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.315
Okay, the first one. Everything is almost perfect but there's one tiny thing missing.

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:21.110
And it's the quote that matches this one here.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.600
Much like our curly braces parentheses and XML tags,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.075
you always need to put quotes at the ends of the string.

00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:29.300
Okay, let's look at this next one one.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.380
As we discussed in the last problem,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.410
capitalization matters and there's something wrong here.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.880
String is always a capitalized datatype.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.090
Now, I'll discuss this a little bit in the next lesson

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.790
but string is not a primary data type like int.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.480
It's actually something called an object.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.880
Again, we'll talk about it more later but with string you always need to be capitalized.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.370
And once you capitalize string, this would work fine.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.485
And here this one is almost fine.

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:54.075
There's just one tiny problem.

00:00:54.075 --> 00:00:57.030
Can you see it? Alright, hopefully caught it.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.220
There should be a semicolon at the end here.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.040
As always, you should remember to finish your Java statements with

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.950
semicolons and close all of your strings with quotes.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.920
You don't want something bad to happen.
