00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.155
Many phones have currency conversion apps which are pretty useful when you're traveling.

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:06.595
This exercise deals with that example one.

00:00:06.595 --> 00:00:10.385
In this case, we're converting US dollars into Japanese yen.

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:14.325
And the rate is one US dollar to 119 Japanese yen.

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:16.980
And we're going to assume that we're converting 40 dollars.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.935
Okay, let's hand simulate to see if it does what we expect.

00:00:19.935 --> 00:00:21.990
In the first line, we're declaring and initializing

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.420
a variable called dollars and we're setting the value to 40.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.460
This variable is probably storing the amount that we're trying to convert.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.060
Okay, on this next slide,

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.810
we have a variable called dollars to yen and we're setting that to 119.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.855
This variable probably represents this conversion rate up here,

00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:39.000
that one dollar is 119 yen.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.850
Next, we're declaring and initializing a variable called yen.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.790
Now, let's calculate the value that we're initializing to.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.360
So here, we have dollars to yen which is 119,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.985
and we're multiplying it by dollars which is 40.

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:52.920
I used a calculator for this one.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.025
The result here is 4,760.

00:00:56.025 --> 00:00:59.935
In the next line, that's what we display, 4,760.

00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:01.595
So, did this do the right thing?

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:04.290
All right, well, we know that one dollar is 119 yen,

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.540
and if we have two dollars,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.445
it's going to be two times whatever one dollar was.

00:01:08.445 --> 00:01:10.815
So it will be two times 119.

00:01:10.815 --> 00:01:12.510
And if we had 40 dollars,

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.265
it'd be 40 times 119 which is the exact calculation that we do here.

00:01:17.265 --> 00:01:20.880
So, it looks like yes, this is correctly calculating the number of yen.
