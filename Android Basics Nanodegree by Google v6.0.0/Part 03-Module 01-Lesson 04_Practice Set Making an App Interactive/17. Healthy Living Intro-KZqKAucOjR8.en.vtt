00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.165
This scenario, you're working on an app called Health Check.

00:00:03.165 --> 00:00:07.140
And what Health Check is, is basically an app that administers a quiz.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.260
And that quiz can tell the person who's using it,

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.100
how helpfully they're living.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.910
The questions appear in this box here and

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.475
the user can answer either yes, sometimes, or no.

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:21.900
And let's say there's about 100 different questions and they range from things like,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.780
do you exercise more than three times a week?

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.120
Do you drink less than two caffeinated drinks a day?

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.730
Or do you have a supportive social network?

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.800
Now, the questions are phrased in such a way that when you say yes,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.030
that always means you're more healthy and when you say no it means you're less healthy.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.985
Sometimes, it's sort of an inconclusive answer.

00:00:38.985 --> 00:00:41.805
And what the app is doing, is really keeping track of the score.

00:00:41.805 --> 00:00:44.910
When you hit "Yes", it adds one to the health level,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.380
when you answer sometimes,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.350
it remains unchanged, and when you answer no,

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.990
it subtracts one from the health level.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.880
Also, once you've selected one of these options,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.625
it will show you a summary of what you just answered

00:00:56.625 --> 00:00:59.850
and what your current health level is before giving you the next question.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.490
We're just going to look at the interaction between clicking one of

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.925
these buttons and showing the summary of where you're at right here.

00:01:05.925 --> 00:01:08.630
Let's look at the code. Okay, so here's the code.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.130
And I've also provided in the instructor notes,

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.830
if you want to take a look at the sort of text version of this.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.005
Again, it's not the complete code.

00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:18.180
This little ellipsis here mean that there's code

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.490
before and after the methods that you're shown here.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.765
So, how does this work?

00:01:21.765 --> 00:01:23.535
Well, when you hit the "Yes" button,

00:01:23.535 --> 00:01:25.410
the yes method is called.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.750
This increases the health level,

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.030
makes a message, and then displays that message.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.730
Similarly, when you hit the "Sometimes" button,

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.805
the sometimes method is called.

00:01:35.805 --> 00:01:38.790
The only difference here is that instead of adding one you add zero,

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.460
which means that the variable value doesn't really change.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.800
And the format is similar when you get the "No" button.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.255
The no method is called,

00:01:45.255 --> 00:01:47.270
one is subtracted from the health level,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.330
and the message is printed.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.955
Okay, we have two variables in this program.

00:01:50.955 --> 00:01:52.950
Health level and message.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.660
Let's look at message first.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.370
So, my first question to you is,

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.990
from the code that you see here,

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.800
is message a local or global variable?
