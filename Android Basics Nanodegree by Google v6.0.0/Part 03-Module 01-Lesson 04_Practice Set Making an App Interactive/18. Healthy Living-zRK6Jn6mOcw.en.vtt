00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
Now, you should have determined that message is a global variable.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.535
And you can tell this from looking at where it's declared, which is up here.

00:00:07.535 --> 00:00:10.755
It is not declared in any of these methods.

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:12.195
It's declared, in fact,

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:13.680
outside of any methods.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.450
It is though declared between

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.215
the curly braces of what we've been calling the main activity class.

00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:20.850
So, the next question is,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.965
should message be global variable?

00:00:22.965 --> 00:00:25.170
Well, whenever we use message,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.015
we see that we set what message is and then we immediately display it.

00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:31.515
When we set what message is,

00:00:31.515 --> 00:00:34.125
we don't look at a previous value of message.

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:37.490
Global variables are good for keeping track of a previous value

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.140
between things like button clicks or other events that you might have in your app.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.650
They are way to sort of save the state of an app.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.560
What they're not good for is when you're

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.200
using a variable as a sort of intermediate value.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.730
Remember, when you're executing the code inside one of these blocks called a method,

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.860
you do each statement sequentially.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.210
If your variable is only needed within the sequence of those statements,

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.265
then it doesn't need to be a global variable.

00:01:01.265 --> 00:01:02.990
It's being used locally.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.880
It's being used just in the method.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.335
And that's the case with message.

00:01:06.335 --> 00:01:09.680
It's a kind of intermediate value used just at that moment.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.410
So, message should not really be a global variable.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.635
Now, will the program not work because it's a global variable?

00:01:15.635 --> 00:01:17.375
No, it'll work just fine.

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:20.195
But let's say I forgot to type this line here.

00:01:20.195 --> 00:01:23.810
So, if I click the no button what it's gonna do is,

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.020
well, first, it's going to take health level and subtract one from it.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.235
Now, as a side note,

00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:30.550
you might be wondering what the value of health level is.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.080
And well, we'll talk about that in the next video.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.940
But for now let's just assume it's zero.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.830
So, we take zero, we subtract one.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.810
The health level is at negative one.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.400
And well, we don't have this line anymore,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.685
so we just print out whatever messages.

00:01:43.685 --> 00:01:45.110
Well, what is message?

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.445
When a global variable is created and it isn't given an initial value,

00:01:49.445 --> 00:01:52.130
it's given a kind of default initial value.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.490
For strings, the default initial value is the empty string,

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.100
which is basically a string that has no text in it.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.790
This would mean that the user doesn't see anything when the no message is clicked.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.000
That's not great but not entirely unexpected behavior.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.785
When things get really kinda funky,

00:02:06.785 --> 00:02:09.425
is let's say that you hit the yes button first,

00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:11.285
this will make it, you answered yes,

00:02:11.285 --> 00:02:14.315
current health level is one and showed on the screen here.

00:02:14.315 --> 00:02:17.580
Let's say then after that you hit the no button.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.560
It'll subtract one from the health level making the health level zero again,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.910
but it won't set message to another value because let's say we deleted this line.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.895
So, message will have the old value from up here,

00:02:28.895 --> 00:02:32.120
you answered yes, current health level is one.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.695
And it will display that again.

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:38.390
Again, this all happens because health level now exists between multiple methods.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.820
So, whatever value was here before,

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.530
if we don't change it here,

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.825
will still be there.

00:02:43.825 --> 00:02:46.190
And no sort of compile error will be thrown.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.350
Now, if message was a local variable,

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.510
when you forget to set it to anything here,

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.000
it would complain and actually not like you run your app.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.810
But because you've made it a global variable, it won't complaint,

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.710
it will just print out what it had before from the previous method, which is wrong.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.010
So to summarize, message should not be a global variable.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.640
Why? Well, it's not really used in between methods or it

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.090
will have some value from another time that the variable was

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.780
used in another method because the global variable will have a default value

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.400
set or it will have an old value for what it was used in one of these other methods.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.960
Now, it's only if we make an error and we forget to set it to the correct thing.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.370
But we shouldn't make our job any harder for ourselves.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.550
That's only one of the variables in this example,

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.520
so let's look at the other one, health level
