00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.890
Okay, so you changed around the code so
the +3 Point button

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.630
would actually add plus three points,
and continually increase.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.480
Now, I want you to do it for
the +2 Points button, and

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.110
the Free Throw button.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.850
Take a moment to think.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.630
Do you need to create any
additional variables to do this?

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.030
Yes, or no.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.500
After you've answered this,
go ahead and update your app.
