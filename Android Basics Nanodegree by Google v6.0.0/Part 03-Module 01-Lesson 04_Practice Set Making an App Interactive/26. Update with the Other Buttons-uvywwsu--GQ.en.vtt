00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.380
The correct answer as to whether you
need to create any additional variables

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.870
is, well, no.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.910
You have a variable keeping
track of Team A's score.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.750
These two buttons are simply
going to affect the value

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.670
that's stored in that score, and there's
no other variables that are needed.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.080
Alright, let's see what
this looks like in code.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.360
We can actually model this pretty
closely from off of what we did for

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.250
addThreeForTeamA.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.690
Whoops.
I see a little error.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:27.520
Let's add a space here.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.760
Sorry, where was I?

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.130
Yes, we can do the same thing for
one and two as we did for three.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.520
In fact, I don't like typing.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.960
I'm going to just go ahead and
copy this.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.870
And I'll paste it here,
in the addTwoForTeamA and

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.490
here in the addOneForTeamA.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:48.370
Okay.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.250
So now for example, in addTwoForTeamA,
it's adding three to the score and

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.630
then displaying the score.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.460
But I don't want it to add three,
I want it to add two.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.099
And here, in addOneForTeamA
It's adding 3 to the score, but

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:06.920
I actually just wanted to add 1.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.790
But in both cases,
I still wanted to display the score.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.930
I'm just changing it by a little
bit of a different number.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.180
Let's run this to see if it works.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.369
Okay, moment of truth.

00:01:25.682 --> 00:01:27.190
Okay, looks like it's working.
