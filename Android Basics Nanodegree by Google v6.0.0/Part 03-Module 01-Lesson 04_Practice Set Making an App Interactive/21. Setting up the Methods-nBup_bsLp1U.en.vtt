00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.100
So our layout's looking pretty good, but

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:09.030
when I press these buttons,
nothing's really happening.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.760
What you're going to need to do is
associate the XML and the Java so

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.050
that when you press a button some sort
of event happens in the Java code.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.470
Now you've done this already
with the Just Java app, so

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.110
you're going to do
some similar steps now.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.089
Okay, so the first thing you're
going to do is copy and paste over

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:30.440
the displayForTeamA method, which I've
provided in the instructor notes.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.650
I'll show you how to do that right now.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.680
Okay, so here I am in my XML code, but

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.170
we actually want to be in
the Java code for this.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.130
Now, you might have Main activity.java
opened in another tab, but if not,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.900
go ahead and head up to the Java folder,
and then click on the first of the two,

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.400
and you'll see main activity there,
you can double click to open it.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.970
Now, this is the main activity class and

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.190
it contains these code
chunks called methods.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.569
What I want you to do is paste it
inside of the main activity class, but

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:03.210
not inside of any of the other methods.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.610
So let's look at where the main
activity class starts.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.700
It begins up here, and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.080
I'll scroll down a little more slowly,
and it ends down here.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.860
Right before the last curly brace,
so not within this method, but

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.660
right here, so now I'm going to
paste the code using Command+V.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.100
I'm on a Mac, if you're on a Windows,
you can use Control+V.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.940
Now I'm seeing a lot of red, and

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.230
that's actually because I don't have
auto-import turned on on this computer.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.780
So I'm going to do that.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.460
If you're also seeing red here,

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.030
that means that you're probably
having the same problem.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.770
Catherine showed how to do it in
lesson two and I've provided a link in

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.090
the instructor notes if you
need to watch that video again.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.070
Okay, much better.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.570
I've still got a little bit of red.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.140
Let's resolve that right now.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.690
Okay, so I've done step one.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.660
The next thing that you
need to do is change the ID

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.090
of the score text view
to be team_a_score.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.640
I'll also show you how
to do that right now.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.440
For this one, I'm actually going to
go over to the activity main XML, and

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.530
now we're in our XML and
I'm going to look for

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.288
the TextView that displays the score.

00:02:08.288 --> 00:02:12.650
Here are my two TextViews, and it's this
TextView here that has the text zero,

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.420
which is displaying the score.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.380
I'm going to set the ID for
that, I'll just go ahead and

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.510
start by typing ID, and I do want an ID.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.530
Okay and now it's giving
me different options, but

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.100
i'm going to use the at symbol plus id.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.820
And then i'm going to type my id in.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.630
Which if you remember
it was team_ a_score.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.130
Okay cool.
All right and

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.390
it should be typed like that exactly.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.770
And what you're looking for is that
this word right here, team a score

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.670
matches exactly with this word
right here, team_a_score.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.980
And once you do this, this should
change from a unhealthy red color,

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.150
to a healthy purple color, and your
display method is going to work for you.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.620
If you want to test it out,

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.620
you can actually go up in your
Java code to the onCreate method.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.985
Now early on in the lesson,

00:03:07.985 --> 00:03:12.870
Catherine had mentioned that onCreate
occurs right when your app starts up.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.140
So I can actually add the code here,
displayForTeam A,

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.290
and give it whatever your favorite
number is, mine happens to be eight, and

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.640
I should be able to see that immediately
the score will get updated to eight.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.260
So I'm going to go ahead and
run this, and see if that is true.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.620
Okay, so here's my app,
and it's very small, but

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.820
you should be able to see
that this is 8 and not 0.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.340
So I did the first two steps correctly,
and you should test, too,

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.480
to make sure that you did those
first two steps correctly.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.350
In the next lesson, you're actually
going to learn about how this code

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.800
here works, but for now,
just revel in the magic.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.720
Okay.
Now, for the fun part.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.420
So, I'm not going to give you
instructions about how to do this, but

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.719
I will link you to some videos where
Catherine did very similar things.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.270
I want you to give the following
behavior: when the plus 3 points is

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.150
clicked it should show three.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.180
When plus 2 points is clicked,
it should show two.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.210
When free throw is clicked,
it should show one.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.110
Here I'll show you on my phone.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.780
Okay, so here is what I mean.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.620
I have my app I click the plus 3 points,
3 is shown, I click plus 2 points,

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.490
2 is shown, and
I click free-throw and one is shown.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.679
Now when I click plus 2 points
again it just shows two.

00:04:25.679 --> 00:04:28.080
Its not adding anything yet.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.210
Now I know this isn't the final
functionality that I was looking for,

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.250
but it's a good intermediate state.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.820
It's important to take intermediate
goals to get you closer to

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.060
the final goal.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.570
You do something small like you
already know how to do, check,

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.380
make sure it works and
then modify it to get what you need.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.800
So, we'll start with this, and when
you're done go ahead and check this box.
