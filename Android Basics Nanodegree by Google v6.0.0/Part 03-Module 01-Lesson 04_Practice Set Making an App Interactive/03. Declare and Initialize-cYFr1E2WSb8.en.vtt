00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.230
Okay, so for the first one,
this part right here,

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.750
which is the declaration,
looks fine to me.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.260
The initialization is
a little bit funky, why?

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.060
Well, we use quotes, and

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.100
if you remember from the lesson, quotes
specifically have to do with strings.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.090
And it really makes our computer
see this text as a string.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.700
Because of that,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.860
the computer is going to complain about
there being a mismatch between this

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.200
type, integer, and
this value here which is a string.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.120
Okay so
this one definitely has a problem, so

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.920
i'm going to put a check in it.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.730
Okay let's look at this next one.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.380
The declaration here looks fine.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.490
And ten without any
quotes is an integer, so

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.440
this one actually looks perfectly okay.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.210
One note that I would make is
when we write variables we

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.140
tend to use camel case.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.990
You can see that we're using
camel case right here.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.910
So technically this is okay, but

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.730
it doesn't really follow
programming conventions.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.300
To follow programming conventions,
you would change that to a capital E.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.170
But I'm not going to
put a check next to it.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.830
All right so
let's look at the third one.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.140
Now the biggest difference
you'll notice between these two,

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.070
is that there's no space here.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.570
Spaces, it turns out,
are critically important.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.310
Without the space, the computer can't
know that you're actually trying to

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.830
declare a variable here.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.340
In fact, what the computer will
interpret this as is that you have

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.730
a variable called intunreadEmails which
you haven't given any sort of data type.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.350
Okay, so
this one definitely has an error.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.550
All right, and that's it.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.220
Go ahead and try practicing these
skills with the next few problems.
