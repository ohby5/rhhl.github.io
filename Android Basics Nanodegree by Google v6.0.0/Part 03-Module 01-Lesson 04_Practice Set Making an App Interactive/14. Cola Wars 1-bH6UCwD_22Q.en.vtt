00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
The first thing that I asked you is whether you

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.980
udacicola votes is a local variable or a global variable.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.530
And you should have determined that it was a local variable.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:08.940
Well, to figure this out,

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.670
you go to where the variable is declared, which is here.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.000
And you know it's declared because the datatype is right here.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.770
And you see, is it declared inside of a method,

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.230
meaning between the two curly braces here,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.640
or is it declared outside of the method?

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.890
Now, if it's declared inside of a method,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.450
that means that it's a local variable,

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.150
and we can see very clearly that it is in fact declared

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.470
inside of a method. So it's a local variable.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.065
Well, what does that mean?

00:00:35.065 --> 00:00:36.720
We should also be asking ourselves,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.270
if I declared something as a local variable,

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.675
should I have, let's think about in this case.

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:45.780
Here's our phone, and we've been talking about you udacicola,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.260
so let's only focus on when we click through the udacicola button.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.065
When we click this button, this method starts.

00:00:52.065 --> 00:00:54.675
It sets udacicola votes to zero,

00:00:54.675 --> 00:00:58.485
and then it adds one to udacicola votes, which is zero.

00:00:58.485 --> 00:01:00.710
So, udacicola votes becomes one.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.020
Now because udacicola votes is a local variable,

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.370
at the end of this method,

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.905
it actually sort of dies or gets deleted.

00:01:07.905 --> 00:01:10.410
The fact that udacicola votes is trashed and

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.380
gone at the end of this method because it's a local variable,

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.245
causes a couple problems.

00:01:15.245 --> 00:01:16.760
So why is this a problem?

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.050
Well, you would think that if three different people

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.430
voted for udacicola by clicking on the button,

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.880
that udacicola votes should be three.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.085
Well, what actually happens,

00:01:27.085 --> 00:01:28.860
is the first time you click on the button,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.915
udacicola votes becomes zero,

00:01:30.915 --> 00:01:33.270
it gets one added to it becoming one,

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.525
and then it gets trashed, it doesn't exist anymore.

00:01:35.525 --> 00:01:39.210
The second time that somebody clicks on udacicola votes, well,

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.485
udacicola votes is made all over again. It's declared again.

00:01:43.485 --> 00:01:47.520
Because remember, the first time it had essentially gotten trashed.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.305
So, it needs to be re-made.

00:01:49.305 --> 00:01:51.660
And when it's re-made, it's set to zero.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.220
Now we add one again to it,

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.840
but remember the value is zero.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.165
So udacicola votes is still one,

00:01:57.165 --> 00:01:59.250
even though the button's been clicked twice.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.175
And the same thing happens when it's clicked the third time.

00:02:02.175 --> 00:02:06.150
It still is one and it's actually trashed again at the end of this method.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.680
So that's the first problem.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.340
It's not really saving the state between button clicks,

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.160
about how many people have voted for udacicola.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.275
But the other problem is down here.

00:02:16.275 --> 00:02:18.660
This code's actually going to throw an error.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.935
And the reasoning for that is because remember,

00:02:20.935 --> 00:02:26.580
I said that udacicola votes sort of comes into existence or it's scope begins right here.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.930
And then, at the end of this vote udacicola method, it's trashed.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:31.950
It's out of existence.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.515
Which means when I come down here,

00:02:33.515 --> 00:02:36.135
udacicola votes doesn't really exist.

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:38.940
More technically, we say that this variable is out of scope.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.205
It's scope was here,

00:02:41.205 --> 00:02:42.720
It got declared here,

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.190
and it ended here.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.610
But we're trying to use it down here, and it can't be used.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.450
Having udacicola votes be a local was not the correct decision in this case.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.850
And I can summarize why with these two points.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.880
It's not saving the vote about between button clicks,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.490
and it's not a scope for the Show Me votes method.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.240
So, this will actually cause errors.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.450
So, this will actually not compile.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.640
Okay. So let's look at the other variable in this program.
