00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.969
Okay, our XML's looking pretty slick,
but

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:05.960
we still have to add
the interactivity with Java.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.880
Now, using the previous
exercises as an example,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.960
you're going to make the right
side update for team_b.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.520
Before doing anything else you're
going to copy and paste the code for

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.430
displayForTeamB from the instructor
notes into your own code.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.550
And you're going to update
the text view ID for

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.010
Team B to team_b_score,
if you haven't already.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.710
I'll show you how to
do both of these now.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.050
All right, here we are in our Java code.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.240
I've got the display for Team B code
copied, I'm going to do this right

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.850
below, not inside but below,
the displayForTeamA and paste.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.320
To make it not inside,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.150
you want to make sure that it's
after this bracket right here.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.490
And you know that the two curly braces
match up because when you put your

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.440
cursor next to one of the curly braces,
the other one highlights.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.540
Okay, so
I've pasted this code here, good.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.080
Now I need to go over to my XML code,
get rid of the preview, okay.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.410
And I'm going to scroll down
to this TextView here, and

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.150
I actually already updated this in the
last video, but if you need to update

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.890
it, I'm going to pretend I didn't, you
could type id and set the id attribute.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:31.260
And remember, you want the @+id/ and
then you type the id that you want,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:38.630
in my case, I want team_b_score,
okay, cool.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.990
Okay, and now you're pretty much
ready to start hooking up the Java.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.820
I'm not going to give you too,
too many instructions, but,

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.320
if you're feeling like you might get
stuck, here's some things to consider.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.860
Think about how you're
going to associate the buttons

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.095
with running some code in, Java.

00:01:53.095 --> 00:01:56.700
This was one of the first steps
we did for the team a side.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.375
Next, consider hat new variable or
variables you'll need.

00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:02.245
Hint, you're going to need at least one.

00:02:03.445 --> 00:02:06.225
Finally, think a little bit about
what's going to happen when you click

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:06.805
on each button.

00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:10.245
Now, I just want to point
out that these steps

00:02:10.245 --> 00:02:14.125
loosely relate to the steps we
used to make the team a side.

00:02:14.125 --> 00:02:16.090
So if you're feeling really,
really stuck,

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.920
reviewing those videos again might be
helpful, and then, once you're done,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.100
you have the satisfaction of checking
off this box, okay, get to it.
