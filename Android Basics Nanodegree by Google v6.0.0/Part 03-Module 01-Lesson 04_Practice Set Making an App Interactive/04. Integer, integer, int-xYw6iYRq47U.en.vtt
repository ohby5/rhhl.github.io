00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.495
Okay. So before I start talking about these variable declarations,

00:00:03.495 --> 00:00:05.800
the first thing I want to point out is that none of these are

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.170
a particularly good name for a variable.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.245
And none of them are particularly good names

00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:12.960
because it's easy to confuse names like number int,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.945
an integer, with the data type that comes before.

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:18.975
That said, two of these declarations won't even work.

00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:22.470
Let's look at the first one. So we have here the word integer,

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.480
which is in the position where the variable type should be.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.215
Now, in this lesson we taught you about two types: string and int.

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:32.130
So the computer will recognize int as an I N T lowercase,

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.230
but it's not going to recognize the word integer.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.370
Your types must be exactly spelled and capitalized as we showed you in demo.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.645
So this one is incorrect.

00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:41.235
Okay. So looking at this next one,

00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:42.730
the word int is correct here,

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.950
as we just talked about that.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.450
This is a valid datatype.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.615
The problem here is that you can't name a variable the same name as a datatype.

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:52.290
There are certain special words of Java that have a meaning for

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.080
the computer beyond just what they say, such as int.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.130
This special words are known as keywords and in Android Studio, they're colored blue.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.920
Now you can't name your variables the same as any of these keywords.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.295
Okay. So this one also has an issue.

00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:06.405
Okay, so this third one,

00:01:06.405 --> 00:01:08.595
it looks like your datatype is declared correctly.

00:01:08.595 --> 00:01:10.290
Now technically, this would work.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.650
You've got to type here that the computer will recognize,

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.110
and you've got a name that is something that fits all the variable rules.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.310
That said, the name integer is a pretty vague name,

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.030
and it could easily confuse someone else if they're just reading her code.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.445
So because it's technically not wrong, I'm not going to mark it,

00:01:26.445 --> 00:01:28.530
but you should consider a better variable names,

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.180
such as number for calculation,

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.840
which is little bit more specific as to what its use is.
