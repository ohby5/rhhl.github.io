00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.350
The first method is about
getting the email account name.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.400
The method should return a string,
which is the name of the account.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.580
So far, the method signature looks good.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.090
We have the access modifier, the return
data type, and the method name, and

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.470
no input params.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.160
You have a opening and
closing brace as well.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.970
The first line of code looks correct.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.060
It returns a string in quotes,
and then it has a semicolon.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.850
So, this is the return value.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.530
However, the problem comes on a second
line when we see another return

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.200
statement with another return value.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.400
We learned earlier that you can't have
lines of code after the return statement

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.770
because those will be considered
unreachable by the computer.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.760
So in this case,
this method has an error on line 8.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.770
Okay, so let's do Method 2 now.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.190
The second method is about adding
$4 of tip onto the current bill.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.430
The current bill is an input parameter,
and the data type is integer.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.630
The return value of the method should be
the total price of the bill with that $4

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.340
of tip included.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.540
So let's check the method
signature first.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.230
We have a access modifier.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.284
We're missing our return data type,
so that's weird.

00:01:06.284 --> 00:01:11.130
And then we have the method name and
one input parameter.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.730
So the return data type is a red flag,
but let's keep reading.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.500
Inside the method it says
return bill +4 and semicolon.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.630
So this is the return value.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.510
Bill is a variable and we add four to
it, so this evaluates to a single value.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.220
And then that is an integer
which should get returned.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.440
So we're missing
the word int right here.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.350
And this is on line 6.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.240
So in the table we say that Method
2 has an error on line 6 and

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.650
we're supposed to specify
the return data type of int.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.980
Let's look at the third method.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.290
This method is about setting up
the app for our current city.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.090
We don't have the code for
the other app.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.820
But let's just look at the code for
this one method.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.590
The method signature starts
with private access modifier.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.930
And then it says nothing, which is weird
because we haven't seen that before.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.500
And then the method
name is called setup.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.310
There's no input parameters and
we have an open and closing brace.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.750
Inside the method we see
that there is a variable, it

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.550
looks like a global variable city name
and it's being set to the string London.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.086
Okay, well, from everything that I've
observed there's basically no return

00:02:20.086 --> 00:02:22.800
data type specified in the comment here.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.370
It looks like we're trying to
return nothing as the output, so

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.580
remember that the Java keyword for
returning nothing is the word void.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.610
So I think the error is on line
4 here when we need to say void.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.210
Okay so I added that to the table.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.775
Now let's move on to Method 4.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.320
This method is about getting
the number of students in a class.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.040
The return value is the number
of students which is an integer.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.790
The method starts with
an axis modifier of private.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.770
And then the return data type is
an int so, so far it's looking good.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.260
The method name is getStudentClassSize
and there's no input params.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.040
Inside the method,
we have the return keyword and

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.850
then it says 20 in quotations, but

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.850
this is weird because this is a string
and we want it to return an integer.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.334
So the error is on line 7, where we
have to return 20 without quotations.

00:03:15.334 --> 00:03:18.760
And this is what your
table should look like.
