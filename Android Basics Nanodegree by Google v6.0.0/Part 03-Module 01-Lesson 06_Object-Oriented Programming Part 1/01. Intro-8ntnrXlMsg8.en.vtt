00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.920
All right, Katherine.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:02.700
This is lesson one.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.070
This is lesson two.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.580
We've been done with lesson one for
a while.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.939
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And we did the Happy Birthday

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:07.910
app here, remember?

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:08.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.760
&gt;&gt; And in lesson two,
we started to make the Just Java app.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the coffee ordering app.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.380
&gt;&gt; So our learner has traversed this
long, arduous journey and is right here.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.920
&gt;&gt; At the beginning of lesson three.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.830
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; And

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.680
this is where we need to keep
working on the coffee ordering app.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.560
&gt;&gt; Okay.
So before we talk

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.280
about that let's just move
all of this aside, so

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.040
we can focus on lesson three
a little bit better, yeah?

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.620
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.720
&gt;&gt; So I'm just going to drag
all of these around here.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.380
&gt;&gt; I'll move this there,
I'll move this here.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.220
Here's lesson three.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.260
&gt;&gt; Okay, how many big ideas
are there in lesson three?

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.395
&gt;&gt; I think we can do four big parts.

00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:42.375
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's just split
these into four piles then.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.243
There Okay.

00:00:46.243 --> 00:00:47.120
&gt;&gt; There is is.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.491
And what are these ideas?

00:00:48.491 --> 00:00:50.081
&gt;&gt; The first one of its methods.

00:00:50.081 --> 00:00:52.090
&gt;&gt; Methods?
Okay Well let's begin here then.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.060
&gt;&gt; Here's a look at the different
stages of the app for this lesson.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.280
We'll start by adding an order
summary section to the app and

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.540
understand how methods in Java can
help us write more efficient code.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.850
Later, we will add a checkbox for
a topping,

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.400
like whipped cream,
to add to our coffee.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.680
However, we'll need to understand
object-oriented programming

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.200
to determine the state of the checkbox,
whether the user checked it or

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.620
not, and include that information
in the order summary.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.310
Within our app, object-oriented
programming allows us to dynamically

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.150
interact with views, so that we can
read this state from the views, and

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.990
then change the contents of other views,
while the app is running.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.780
We'll add another checkbox for
the chocolate topping and

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.730
then we'll add a text field, so
that we can ask the user for their name.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.010
Again, we'll write Java code to read
in the user input from this field and

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.440
then display it in the order summary.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.840
We'll also learn about
control flow statements,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.820
particularly something called
if/else statements, so

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.550
that our app has different behavior,
based on certain conditions.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.340
Basically by looking at what
toppings the user wants,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.504
we'll be able to adjust the price per
cup of coffee either by $1 or $2.

00:02:00.504 --> 00:02:04.300
Now the order summary is not that
useful, if it never leaves the app.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.600
So we'll learn about intents in Android,
so that when the user hits the Order

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.130
button, we can send the order summary
out to an email app like this.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.410
Then you can specify a specific
email address to send it to.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.800
We'll end the lesson by covering
more topics on Android resources,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.860
learning about how to support different
languages in the app such as Spanish.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.290
We'll also experiment with changing
the styles and theme of the app.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.970
For example,

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.870
you can change the color of the app bar
by customizing the theme of the app.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.530
There's a lot to cover,
so let's get started.
