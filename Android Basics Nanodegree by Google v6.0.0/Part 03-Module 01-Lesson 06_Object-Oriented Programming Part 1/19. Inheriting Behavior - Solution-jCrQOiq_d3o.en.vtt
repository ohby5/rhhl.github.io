00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.605
Okay. I just created a new project in Android Studio using the Project Wizard.

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:06.345
When I run the app on my device,

00:00:06.345 --> 00:00:07.905
it just says "Hello world".

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:11.040
Now, I'm going to remove the onCreate method.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.700
I select the whole method from the method declaration to

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.960
the opening and closing braces as well as the at override text here.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.365
Then I run the app on my device.

00:00:21.365 --> 00:00:24.705
Interesting. Now, I see that the app is blank.

00:00:24.705 --> 00:00:26.670
The "Hello world" text is gone.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.600
If I hit undo, then I can take a look at the onCreate method again.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.280
It appears that by overriding this method,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.865
we're actually causing the "Hello world" text to appear on the screen.

00:00:36.865 --> 00:00:40.300
And that makes sense because when we call setContentView,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.055
this is actually setting the activity main XML layout onto the content view of activity.

00:00:46.055 --> 00:00:49.375
So now, we're starting to see why it's useful

00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:53.410
to override the default behavior in the superclass.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.715
When we override the onCreate method then we can actually use the layout that we want.

00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:02.040
Okay, let's leave this deleted.
