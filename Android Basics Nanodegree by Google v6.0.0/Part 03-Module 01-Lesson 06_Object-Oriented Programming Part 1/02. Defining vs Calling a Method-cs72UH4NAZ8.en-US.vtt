00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.760
So how did you get to work today?

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.190
&gt;&gt; I have a bike, works out just fine.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.280
How about you?

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.440
&gt;&gt; Okay.
I drive.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.020
&gt;&gt; Oh cool, how's that car working out?

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.600
&gt;&gt; It's good.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah?
Do you know how it works,

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.840
underneath the hood?

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.090
&gt;&gt; No, I don't need to.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.630
I just need to put the key in,
and then I drive it.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.040
You know,
this is kind of like writing code.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.860
&gt;&gt; In what way?

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.220
&gt;&gt; Well,
everything is kind of like writing code.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.330
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Stick with me for a second.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.740
In previous lessons we gave
students a bunch of code.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
We gave them methods like the display

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.160
method and the display price method.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.940
&gt;&gt; Right.
And we kept saying,

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.200
well, don't worry about this.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.720
We'll talk about what it does later.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.290
Well that later is now.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.120
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.520
So much like you know how a car works.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.560
You can use it.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.510
Students were able to use that method.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.035
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Right?

00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:41.845
But we wrote the method, so we were

00:00:41.845 --> 00:00:43.800
the designers of the car in that case.
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.380
So the main idea is that you can
define the method somewhere.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.090
&gt;&gt; So that's like building the car.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.590
&gt;&gt; And
then later you can call that method.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.100
&gt;&gt; That's like driving the car.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.200
&gt;&gt; So let's use those ideas next.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.500
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.506
&gt;&gt; Within the MainActivity.java file,

00:00:56.506 --> 00:00:59.540
this is where the display
method is defined.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.956
And this is where it's getting called,
within the increment method and

00:01:02.956 --> 00:01:04.769
within the decrement method.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.640
The instructions of the display
method take in a number and

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.550
then display it on the screen.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.730
Like this right here.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.360
Instead of defining a method we can also
just take the instructions inside of it

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.300
by copying it and then pasting
it where we called that method.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.580
And since number is not a variable here,
we're going to change it to quantity.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.550
If we want to do the same for

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.940
the increment method, we'd copy this
code and then paste it up here.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.740
So this code works the same
as we had before, but

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.950
now we don't need the display method.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.060
The disadvantage to this implementation
is that we have duplicate code

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.150
in both methods.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.170
Instead, if we define the display method
and then we just call it by its name,

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.500
then we can have less code
which is better for the app.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.670
I also want to show you
something else that's cool.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.540
Anytime you see a method, you can
click on it and then right click.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.340
And then go to declaration, or
Command + V if you're on a Mac.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.100
This scrolls the file to
where the method is defined.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.650
This is useful because then you can
see the actual instructions that

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.490
are contained within that method.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.300
For other methods,

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.480
it may open up a declaration
in the Android framework code.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.940
This was written by the Android team,
the TextView.java file.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.200
This shows that,
even though things may look like magic,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.150
you can always trace it back to
the lines of code where it was defined.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.970
Either by you or
by someone on the Android team.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.150
To help you understand the difference
between defining versus calling

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.930
a method,
let's modify the main activity.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.960
We're going to change the way a method
is defined by changing the name of

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.585
the display method to
the name displayQuantity.

00:02:42.585 --> 00:02:47.450
Then for calling this method, do we
need to change anything about that code?

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.710
If these changes cause an error in
your app, make sure to address that so

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.770
that you can run the app
on your phone again.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.100
Check these boxes when you're done.
