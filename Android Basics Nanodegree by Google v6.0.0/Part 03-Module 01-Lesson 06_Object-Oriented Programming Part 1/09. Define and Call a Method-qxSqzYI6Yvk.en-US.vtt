00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.180
Guess what time it is.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.670
&gt;&gt; Time for more cake.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.340
&gt;&gt; No.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.390
It's time for the students to define and
call their own method.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.860
&gt;&gt; Wait, were asking them to define and
call a brand new method.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.970
What's it called?

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.702
&gt;&gt; It's called create order summary.

00:00:13.702 --> 00:00:17.100
It's going to take a summary of
everything they entered into the app and

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.490
then output that as text.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.070
&gt;&gt; Do you think they're ready?

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.170
&gt;&gt; I think so.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.142
I think it's time for our little
birds to spread their wings and fly.

00:00:25.142 --> 00:00:30.712
[SOUND].

00:00:30.712 --> 00:00:33.472
Now we're going to change the app so
it looks like this.

00:00:33.472 --> 00:00:35.956
If I change the quantity and
then hit the order button,

00:00:35.956 --> 00:00:38.180
then it prints out a longer
summary of the order.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.270
This is what will happen in
the main activity at a high level.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.950
When we click on the Order button
in the app, we'll call this method,

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.850
and then inside of this, we're going to
call the calculatePrice method.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.920
We're going to call the method with
no input parameters, we're going to

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.090
execute these instructions here, and
then we're going to return the price.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.590
Once we have the price in
the submitOrder method,

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.450
we're going to be able to call
the createOrderSummary with that price.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.650
So we pass in a price to this method and

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.970
then we execute
the instructions inside of it.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.100
And then we're going to
return the summary text.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.300
And then in these lines of code we can
display that summary onto the screen.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.050
To implement that in code,

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.650
we're going to create
the Order Summary Method.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.110
This is a screenshot of what
the final app should look like.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.890
It's the same as what
I showed you earlier.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.950
The first task is to create this as
a new method in the MainActivity.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.150
The method will be called
createOrderSummary.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.550
It's going to take as input
the price of the order,

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.450
which is going to be a number.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.780
Then it's going to return this message.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.470
Feel free to use your own name,
or any other name.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.290
And make sure that quantity and

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.030
total are accurate based on what user
selected in the quantity picker.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.940
Then just add thank you.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.527
The second step is to then call this
new method from the submitOrder method.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.480
Once you get this string back in the
submitOrder method, then go ahead and

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.220
display it on the screen like this.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.500
Check these boxes when you're done.
