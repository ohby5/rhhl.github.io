00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.190
Let's do the first task.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.473
We're going to rename the number input
parameter to have a different name.

00:00:07.473 --> 00:00:11.210
This is the first input parameter,
int number,

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.236
and all I need to do is just
change the variable name.

00:00:15.236 --> 00:00:16.736
I'm going to change this to,
for example, numberOfCoffees.

00:00:16.736 --> 00:00:17.735
It can be any name that you want.

00:00:17.735 --> 00:00:23.290
Now, I immediately see a warning and
an error.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.030
The warning says, the parameter
numberOfCoffees is never used,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.530
because nowhere in this method
do I use this variable.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.090
Then I see that there's an error that
says, cannot resolve symbol number.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.890
Now, there's no variable called number.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.550
There's no local variable called number.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.580
There's no global
variable called number.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.790
And it's not an input parameter, either.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.930
instead, I need to switch this so
that it's called numberOfCoffees.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.040
And there you go, that fixed the error.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.248
So I'm going to run it on my device now.

00:00:49.248 --> 00:00:51.640
And this is what it looks like.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.060
The quantity picker works as expected.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.810
There should be no visible change to
the user because we just modified

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.510
the name of an input parameter.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.200
Also, we didn't have to change the way
that the method is being called.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.100
We can still say displayQuantity and
then pass in anything we want.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.540
It doesn't matter to the caller
what this input parameter name is.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.270
The second task is to change
the data type of the input parameter

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.370
from int to string.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.600
So in the display quantity method,
I'm going to change the input so

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.040
that instead of a integer data type, it
expects a string data type, like this.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.125
And now,
there's a couple errors in our app.

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:35.495
When I scroll up, I see that
there is a red squiggly underline

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:38.025
in the increment method and
in the decrement method.

00:01:38.025 --> 00:01:39.496
The error message says,

00:01:39.496 --> 00:01:44.130
displayQuantity string in MainActivity
can't be applied to something int.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.960
What it's saying is that we can't
pass the quantity variable into

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.560
the method anymore because this is
an integer, and it's expecting a string.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.320
This mismatch in data type
is causing an error, and

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.810
the app won't even run on our device.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.050
This is a compile time error.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.780
There's a couple ways to fix this.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.558
Either we have to change what's
being passed into the method so

00:02:08.558 --> 00:02:10.494
that this is actually a string.

00:02:10.494 --> 00:02:14.246
I could put 100 here and put it in
double quotes so that it's a string, and

00:02:14.246 --> 00:02:17.210
that would match the right
input type here.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.300
But what we really want is for
quantity to still be an integer so

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.220
that we can do math on it to increase
it by one or decrease it by one.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.380
So I'm going to leave this as quantity.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.670
And then this should be
changed to be an integer.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.740
And then our app should work again.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.980
Cool.
So so

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.100
far, we've seen an example of
a method with one input parameter.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.370
But what about examples of methods
with zero input parameters, or

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.050
two input parameters, or more?
