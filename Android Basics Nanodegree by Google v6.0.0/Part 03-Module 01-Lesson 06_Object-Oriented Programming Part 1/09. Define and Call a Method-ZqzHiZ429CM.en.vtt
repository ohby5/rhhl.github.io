00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.565
Let's do the first step together, of
adding a new method to the MainActivity.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.390
You can pick anywhere in
the file to add your method,

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.100
as long as it's outside of
the braces of a different method.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.230
I'm just going to add it right
below the other method we defined,

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.300
which was calculatePrice.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.530
I'm going to say private for the access
modifier, because the only things

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.960
that need to access this method
are within the main activity.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.060
Then I'm going to say,
string for the return type,

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.550
because the createOrderSummary
method should return a string.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.665
And then the name of the method
is createOrderSummary.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.940
And then it should take as input
a price, which is a number.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.890
Okay so
we got the method signature done, but

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.060
now we have to implement the method so
that it returns this message.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.040
The message starts with the name,
a quantity, a total and then, thank you.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.580
So, I'm going to go ahead and
copy this and then,

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.590
I'm going to paste it in
the createOrderSummary method.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.120
Now, we can start with some base code.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.150
The difference though is now,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.090
the order summary should start with
a name, not with the total price.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.890
So, I'm going to move this to
the next line and save it for later.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.359
I'm going to initialize the price
message variable to Name, and

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:14.580
then Kaptain Kunal.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.660
And then, on the next line,
I'm going to update the price message.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.025
I'm going to append to
the existing message, so

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:26.485
I'll say price message, plus,
and then the new text, and

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:31.115
I want to add quantity and
then add the quantity variable.

00:01:32.265 --> 00:01:34.095
Since quantity is a global variable,

00:01:34.095 --> 00:01:36.745
we should be able to access
it within this method.

00:01:36.745 --> 00:01:39.340
Okay, so now we have name and quantity.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.020
On the next line I'm going to
update the priceMessage again and

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.940
add some more text.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.700
Actually this text is supposed
to be the total price, so

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.270
I can just use what we had before.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.080
Okay, and then on the last line
we update the priceMessage again.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.639
Take the existing value of that string
and then add, Thank you!, to it.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.210
This all looks good, but
there's still an error here.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.260
And it says missing return statement.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.090
Since we're supposed to be
returning a summary string,

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.370
then I need to add another line
of code that says, return.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.240
And then the return value.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.210
In this case the return
value is priceMessage.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.630
And I add a semicolon at the end too.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.440
Okay, now the error's gone.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.150
It looks like our code is good, so
I'm going to run it and test it.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.300
Okay, so now if I change
the quantity to three, and

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.930
I hit the order button, it doesn't work.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.320
Let's see what's wrong.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.260
Looking at the code more closely,
I see what the problem is.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.660
There's a warning here that says that
the private method createOrderSummary

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.730
is never used.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.100
I forgot to call it.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.450
Let's go back to the quiz slide.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.910
Okay, so we did the first task
successfully but now I have to

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.010
call the createOrderSummary method
from the submitOrder method.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.300
Going back to Android Studio,
I need to fix the submitOrder method.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.300
I've calculated the price,
which is correct.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.320
But now I have to pass it into
the createOrderSummary method.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.860
So I'm going to do that right
here createOrderSummary with

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.690
the price variable.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.340
The return value of this method
is going to get stored in

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.380
the priceMessage variable.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.190
I don't need this line of
code anymore because "Thank

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.260
you" is already in the text down here.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.680
So I can delete that.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.800
And then to update the screen all I
have to do is call displayMessage with

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.230
the priceMessage variable like before.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.410
And now let's try to run the app again.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.370
If I change the quantity to three and

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.930
I hit the order button,
it's still not working.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.970
Most of the text is on one line when
it should be on multiple lines, so

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.210
let's go back and fix our code.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.650
Looking at this code I realize that
I forgot the new line character.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.950
I added it properly for
Thank you but not for the others.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.340
So I'm going to add it
to the other lines now.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.230
Okay, let's try to run it again.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.600
And it works.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.830
Awesome.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.050
Now Kaptain Kunal can have
his three cups of coffee.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.670
I want to show you some other
optimizations you can do to your code.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.530
Notice that you could have called
the calculatePrice method within

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.170
the createOrderSummary method instead
of passing it in as an input parameter.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.420
So you could have done
calculatePrice right here.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.880
That would have worked as well.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.250
But I wanted to show you that you can
take the output of one method and

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.370
pass it as input to another method.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.040
So we'll leave it as we had it before.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.874
Within the createOrderSummary method,

00:04:23.874 --> 00:04:27.920
the other thing I would have
done is use the += operator.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.240
This is shorthand, and

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.070
it means the same thing as priceMessage
= priceMessage + all of this.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.660
So if I change all of this to be +=, it
will be the same as what I had before.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.680
This just requires less typing so
your code is more concise.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.120
In the calculatePrice method,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.160
the other thing I would've
done is just return the value

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.030
immediately instead of storing it in
a local variable and then returning it.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.840
This also leads to more concise code.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.340
And then up here, in the submitOrder
method, instead of creating the order

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.880
summary and storing it in a variable and
then using it right after, I could have

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.960
just called createOrderSummary and
then call displayMessage on that.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.290
This leads to the same thing.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.590
The return value of the
createOrderSummary method is a string,

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.190
and that will get passed as an input
argument to the displayMessage method.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.410
You can leave it like this if you want,
if it's easier to read.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.630
All of these tips and
tricks lead to the same logic anyways.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.290
And before I forget, also remember
to add a Javadoc comment at

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.680
the top of this method to describe
what it's supposed to be doing.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.821
Technically you don't need a Javadoc
comment for a private method, but

00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:39.449
it's just good practice to write
a description of a method so

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:42.437
that other people who are reading
your code will also understand what

00:05:42.437 --> 00:05:44.380
you're trying to do.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.002
The description of this method is that
it creates a summary of the order.

00:05:48.002 --> 00:05:51.560
The input parameter as the price of the
order, and it returns the text summary.
