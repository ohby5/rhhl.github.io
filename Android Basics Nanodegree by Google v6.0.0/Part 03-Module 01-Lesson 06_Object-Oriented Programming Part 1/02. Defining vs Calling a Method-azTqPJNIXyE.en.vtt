00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.760
Let's do the first task.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.150
I'm going to change the name of
the display method to displayquantity.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.570
Now this causes some errors in our app.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.190
If I scroll up I see an error that says
cannot resolve method display int.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.610
This is actually related
to the second task,

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.980
where we asked if you need to change
the way that the method is called.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.928
The answer is yes, because when
we change the name of the method,

00:00:22.928 --> 00:00:25.400
we need to change the way
that it's called.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.370
So, in the increment method, I'm going
to change this to say displayQuantity,

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.340
and then decrement method,

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.460
I'm going to change this to
say displayQuantity as well.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.420
Now there's no more
errors in our app and

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.950
I can save this and
then run the app on the device.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.140
And the app works as expected.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.550
There's no user visible change,
but internally,

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.690
in our code,
we did change the method name.
