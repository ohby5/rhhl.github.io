00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.050
Let's start with the first step which is
to change the price header to say order

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.656
summary.

00:00:05.656 --> 00:00:09.333
First I open up the activity_main
layout file, and then I go and

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:12.000
find the view that
controls the price header.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.270
And I put my cursor here,

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.240
then I see that this view
gets correctly highlighted.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.710
So now I can go ahead and
modify this string here.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.800
I'm going to erase this and
type in Order Summary.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.370
It correctly updates
in the preview window.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.690
Notice that I spelled
it with a capital O and

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.910
a capital S instead of in all caps.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.390
If we ever decide to change our UI and

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.950
set all caps to be false,
then my text will still be fine.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.360
So I prefer typing
Order Summary like this and

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.850
then using the attribute
textAllCaps = true.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.840
Okay, so the first item's done.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.600
The second task is to find
the price value TextView and

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.130
change it to have an ID of this.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.050
If I move down to the next TextView
after the order summary header

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.830
then this is the price value TextView,
and it's highlighted here too.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.840
As requested, I'm going to change
the ID to say order_summary_text_view.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.170
Cool, so those are all the XML
changes in the layout.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.210
Let me run the app to make
sure that it still works.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.210
Actually, it doesn't work.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.490
I get an error saying that it can't
find the symbol price_text_view

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.320
in the Java file.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.250
Looks like we need to go to
the next steps before we can get

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.080
our app to compile.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.730
In the Main Activity display
message method, we are supposed to

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.120
change the variable name from
priceTextView to orderSummaryTextView.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.260
Within the main activity file
in the display message method,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.430
I find the priceTextView here.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.570
I'm going to delete this and
then type in orderSummaryTextView.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.212
It's going to be in camelCase and

00:01:44.212 --> 00:01:47.940
start with a lower case o
because it's a variable name.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.348
Immediately I get a warning that
says the variable is never used.

00:01:50.348 --> 00:01:53.410
So I'm going to copy it, and
I'm actually going to use it on the next

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.580
line here because there's an error
saying priceTextView is unresolved.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.740
And then delete this, and
then use the new variable name here.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.550
Cool, and that makes the error go away.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.859
But I still have another error here, and
I think it's related to the last task.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.598
The last item here says to
change R.id.price_text_view to

00:02:13.598 --> 00:02:16.035
R.id.order_summary_text_view.

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:19.652
I'm going to double click
on this error in red, and

00:02:19.652 --> 00:02:24.437
I'm going to delete it and
type in order_summary_text_view.

00:02:24.437 --> 00:02:26.630
There, and now the error goes away.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.930
And now the app works
without any errors.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.660
The initial layout is correct.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.340
Instead of saying price,
it now says order summary, and

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.520
if I change the quantity and hit order,
then the summary shows up here.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.890
Let's talk about any observations
that you may have made.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.400
Remember there's no right or
wrong answers.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.098
First you may have noticed that for the
price TextView, when we gave it an ID of

00:02:49.098 --> 00:02:53.730
order_summary_text_view, the similar
format appeared again later in

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.460
the Java code when we were modifying
the displayMessage method.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.010
You also may have noticed that by
changing price to order summary

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.840
it seemed to have a bunch of ripple
affects on other parts of the code.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.230
Now some of these changes are required
in order for the app to run again, but

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.840
other changes were more
nice to have just for

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.810
convention so that we didn't have any
old, lingering references to price.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.880
In looking more closely at
the displayMessage method,

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.910
you may have noticed that there's only
one input parameter, string message.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:24.980
And there's no return value.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.640
&gt;&gt; That's why we don't have a line in
this method that says return something.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.864
You also may recognize the word TextView
which we saw in the XML in order to add

00:03:34.864 --> 00:03:36.320
a text view to our layout.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.330
It's spelled exactly
the same way as here.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.830
Also, this line of code here looks
like the assignment of a variable,

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.740
where we have the variable data type,

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.674
the variable name, and then,
having an initial value here.

00:03:52.035 --> 00:03:55.825
This is similar to how we
declare integers and strings.

00:03:55.825 --> 00:03:59.115
And if you were looking really closely
you may have thought that this looks

00:03:59.115 --> 00:04:03.705
like a method call, findViewById
followed by an opening parentheses,

00:04:03.705 --> 00:04:06.885
some stuff in the middle, and
then a closing parentheses.

00:04:06.885 --> 00:04:10.310
Similarly with setText here,
there's an opening parenthesis,

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.510
something in the middle, and
then a closing parenthesis.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.200
So this may also be a method call.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.240
In the upcoming videos,
we're going to take a look more closely

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.230
at what exactly is happening
in these lines of code and

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.350
start to understand what
they actually mean.
