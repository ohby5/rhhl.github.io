00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.765
All right, so let's start overwriting
the code to the clicking on the family

00:00:02.765 --> 00:00:04.196
category, opens up the family activity.

00:00:04.196 --> 00:00:07.822
Now I'm in the main activity here,
and we've done something similar for

00:00:07.822 --> 00:00:09.002
the numbers category.

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:10.514
So we don't have the write or

00:00:10.514 --> 00:00:14.168
code for the family category from
scratch, because we can simply copy and

00:00:14.168 --> 00:00:17.390
paste the code here and
alter it for the family use case.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.530
So I'll start by updating the resource
ID to point to the right text view, so

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.770
we want it to call family instead.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.480
And once we find the right text for
you in this view hierarchy.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.737
I want to store it in
a variable called family.

00:00:27.737 --> 00:00:32.226
I can't leave it as numbers because in a
single method I can't define a variable

00:00:32.226 --> 00:00:34.210
with the same name twice.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.740
We need to pick different names for
each variable.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.530
So let's go ahead and

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.890
also update the comments to refer
to the family category instead.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.300
Next, I need to modify
the set on click listener.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.680
So that it refers to the family view.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.325
Now, let's update the intent code.

00:00:47.325 --> 00:00:52.150
Here I've created an intent with the
current main activity as the context,

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.592
and I need to modify this.

00:00:53.592 --> 00:00:56.990
So that the family activity
is a class that it goes to.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.900
Then when we start the activity
with this line of code.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.080
We need to make sure that it
goes to the family intent.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.970
So let's modify it here and here.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.450
As well as remember to
update the comments.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.230
Now I'm going to do the same for
the colors activity and

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.280
the phrases activity.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.940
Now after making those code changes
let's test the app on our device.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.900
So let's click into all the activities
and see that that works.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.610
So first numbers, that's looking good.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.000
Family members Nice colors.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.200
And then lastly, phrases, perfect.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.110
So I did notice that some of the
activities still say Miwok at the top

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.020
instead of the category name.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.360
So if you remember in an earlier coding
exercise, we actually fix this for

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.350
the numbers activity and we did so

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.490
by modifying its activity tag
in the androidmanifest.xml file.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.960
So let's go ahead and do this for
all the other activities.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.890
So we want the label for the family
activity to be the text family and

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.430
we had that stored in the at string
resource called category_family.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.100
So I want to make that modification,
and Android manifest, and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.010
I'll repeat the same thing for
the other activities.

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.340
Let's go ahead and
test it one more time.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.710
Now when we open each category,

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.880
the category name appears
at the top of the activity.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.380
Perfect.
That brings us to the end of all

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.510
the coding exercises for lesson one.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.245
Congratulations.

00:02:20.245 --> 00:02:21.174
