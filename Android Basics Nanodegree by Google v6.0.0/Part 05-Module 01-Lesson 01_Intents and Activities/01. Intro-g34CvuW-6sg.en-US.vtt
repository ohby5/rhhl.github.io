00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.210
Andrea, I'm so
glad you reached out to me and

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.410
could come today, because I wanted
to introduce you to Jessica.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.118
She's a course developer at U'dasti and

00:00:07.118 --> 00:00:09.320
she's going to helping
us build your app idea.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.660
&gt;&gt; Catherine's been telling me all about
the app that you'd like to make to help

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.510
people learn about the Miwok language.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.690
Could you tell us more about that idea?

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:15.430
&gt;&gt; Sure, so

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.580
my family's a part of the Northern
Sierra Miwok tribe in California.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.730
And the language isn't being passed down
from generation to generation anymore.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.590
My great grandmother was the last
to speak the language fluently.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.220
&gt;&gt; Wow, I'm sorry to hear that.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I'd like to preserve
the language in the family.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.260
So, I had an app idea that could teach
my kids how to pronounce things like

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.350
numbers and colors and phrases.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.250
&gt;&gt; Okay, so
that seems pretty straightforward.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.400
So, the app would just
be a list of words and

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.690
each word could have an English and
a Miwok translation.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.030
That sounds reasonable for
our student to build, right?

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's assuming that
they've taken the Android for

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.910
Beginners course with you and
Cornell already, right?

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:50.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
So,

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.680
they should already know
how to build a layout and

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.870
how to make a simple but
interactive app.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.760
&gt;&gt; All right, so, if the student

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.620
watching doesn't feel
comfortable with those concepts.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.090
They should probably go back to that
course, review those topics, and

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.860
then come back.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah and then we'll be building
the Miwok app together with them.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.226
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that sounds doable and
you know,

00:01:05.226 --> 00:01:08.420
this app will teach the dialect
of Miwok the tribe speaks.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.410
But our students can take this app and
modify it to teach any language.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.770
&gt;&gt; That's so true, there are so

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.570
many different languages that
could be preserved by this.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.820
It's amazing if we could
help other cultures, but

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.640
by the way,
how long is this going to take?

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.190
&gt;&gt; Well,
I'd estimate about four to six weeks,

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.930
if we work alongside the students and
then they pace themselves out.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.010
That sounds reasonable, I can't
wait to show the app to my family.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah and another reason why I'm so
excited about this app is,

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.680
because our student may
feel like a beginner.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.190
You might not be able to
create something that useful.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.070
But we're going to show them in this
course, that with their current skill

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.230
set they can tackle real
challenges in their community.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah that's right,
such that preserving the local culture.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.320
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.370
&gt;&gt; I completely agree but to be honest,
I've never built an app before.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.710
Where do we even start?

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.240
&gt;&gt; That's okay.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.250
I actually have a really great idea.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.700
Let's ask our student for help.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.488
&gt;&gt; All right.
All right, so

00:01:54.488 --> 00:01:56.210
if Andrea can provide
us the vocabulary list.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.091
Why don't you help us brainstorm how we
can present this information to a user

00:01:59.091 --> 00:01:59.680
within an app.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.630
&gt;&gt; And take some time to think
about this because a lot of people

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.610
struggle with translating
an idea into an actual app.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.850
So, this will be good practice for you.
