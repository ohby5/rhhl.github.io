00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
Awesome. Now, the intents are working on our app.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.410
However, one issue I do see is that

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.310
the numbers activity we open still says Miwok at the top.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.690
I want to change the title of this activity to say, numbers.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.600
And for the other activities that we open,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.945
they should also say colors,

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:15.195
phrases, and family members, respectively.

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:19.275
I mentioned earlier that we're going to come back to the AndroidManifest.xml file.

00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:22.470
And now is that time to change the title of the numbers activity,

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.605
only to modify the AndroidManifest.xml file.

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:28.320
There is a way to modify the activity name,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.910
but I forget the exact syntax.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.525
So, let's look that up.

00:00:31.525 --> 00:00:36.240
I do a web search for AndroidManifest activity tag.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.540
And this first result looks good.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.860
In the navigation pane,

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.370
on the left-hand side of the screen,

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.480
we're looking at activity tag under the App Manifest.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.195
So, we are in the right place.

00:00:46.195 --> 00:00:47.630
On the right-hand side of the screen,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.600
we can see some possible attribute names related to the name of the activity.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.030
Use the keyboard shortcut command F or control

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.905
F on Windows to pop-up the find menu. Then type name.

00:00:58.905 --> 00:01:01.980
Looking closely at the name attribute description,

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.300
it seems like name is the name of the activity Java file.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.250
Scrolling through the attribute some more,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.205
I think the one we're trying to look for is called label.

00:01:11.205 --> 00:01:12.725
So let's take a look at that attribute.

00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:16.950
And sure enough, it says that the label is what's displayed to the user.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.410
So, going back to our AndroidManifest.xml,

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.695
we'll find the activity tag related to the numbers activity.

00:01:22.695 --> 00:01:26.520
Then we'll add an extra attribute called Android label and the value

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.570
will be the text that we want to show on the app bar for this activity, which is numbers.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.790
If we refer back to our mental model of the app,

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.680
this stream was actually already declared in the strings.xml file.
