00:00:03.417 --> 00:00:06.328
I think I would go as far
back to say it was when I was

00:00:06.328 --> 00:00:08.290
doing my undergrad thesis.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.000
I was learning about the effects
of language loss and

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.740
its toll that it has
taken on my identity.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.470
Being Miwok and not knowing
the language or the traditions,

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.650
it really felt I don't know the word for
it could be, you know inadequate.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.610
You know I don't know much about my
heritage, my culture and I want to

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.900
know more and I want to be able to pass
that knowledge down to my children.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.307
So I started looking into basket
weaving a little bit of the language.

00:00:39.307 --> 00:00:43.255
I started interviewing my
grandmother and my mother and

00:00:43.255 --> 00:00:48.467
trying to get as much information I
could from my closest family members.

00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:51.827

00:00:51.827 --> 00:00:56.807
But then I found a website that was
built by one of the tribal members, and

00:00:56.807 --> 00:01:02.360
it had certain audio clips of counting,
and colors, and things like that.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.548
And I started playing
with it with my son and

00:01:06.548 --> 00:01:11.260
we would click on the numbers and
before I would click the next one,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.228
wait let me try to say it so
I can see if I can say it right and

00:01:15.228 --> 00:01:19.520
it just went from like a game
that my son and I played.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.520
And I wanted to do more with that and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.720
I figured that a lot of families are
kind of in the same situation we are.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.980
We're in the Bay Area,

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.690
which is about two hours away
from the tribal community.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.520
And if there are more people
who are far enough away,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.020
it's not accessible to them, so
let's bring the language to the people.
