Hey, Katherine.
So

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.719
we just covered a lot
of new terminology.

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but
I think it will help if we type back

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.910
to what we learned about
in the last course.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.840
&gt;&gt; That's a good point.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.330
So, in the last course you also
talk about how to use on screen or

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.160
describe objects.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah we did.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.020
We talked about how objects
like the text view contain

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.730
state inside of it as well as
methods like get text and set text.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.230
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.580
But you guys didn't cover.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.240
The setOnClickListener method last time.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.960
And, when this method's called, it
takes an OnClickListener as its object.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.450
And then on a phone, when a user clicks
on a view, then Android will go and

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.465
check if there's
an OnClickListener inside of it.

00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:39.505
&gt;&gt; And if there is,
then the OnClick method

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:42.795
of the OnClickListener will
execute with these instructions.

00:00:42.795 --> 00:00:45.445
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and these can be any
instructions like popping up a toast

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:48.045
message, or changing the background
color of a TextView.

00:00:48.045 --> 00:00:49.005
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:49.900
There's a lot to remember.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.290
But do you remember the other
way we can talk about it?

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.910
&gt;&gt; You're not talking
about the tongue twister?

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:55.680
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, yes.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.358
Let's do it, let's do it.
&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Okay.

00:00:56.358 --> 00:01:00.055
&gt;&gt; When you click on something that
is clickable that previously set its

00:01:00.055 --> 00:01:04.920
OnClickListener, then the OnClick method
of the OnClickListener will react quick.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.950
So what you want to click?
