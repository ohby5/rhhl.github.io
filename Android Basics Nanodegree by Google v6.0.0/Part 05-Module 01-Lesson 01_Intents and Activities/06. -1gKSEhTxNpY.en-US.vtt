00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.375
So let's open the MainActivity.java
file and review what's in here.

00:00:04.375 --> 00:00:07.170
So at the top of any Java
file is the package name.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.820
It says the word package,

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.638
which is a Java keyword
followed by our package name.

00:00:11.638 --> 00:00:16.830
Here it's com.example.android.miwok.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.280
This is the package name that we
specified in the new project wizard

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.770
in order to uniquely identify
our app on an Android device.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.870
Every app in the Google Play store
has a different package name.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.770
All the code for our app will be grouped
together under this package name.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.880
So in the quiz A is the package name.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.100
So next we have our import statements
and these statements import Java classes

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.020
that we didn't write, but
can still use in our code.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.535
These files belong to other packages of
code in the Android framework which was

00:00:44.535 --> 00:00:45.878
written by the Android team.

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:50.633
For example, we're importing
the AppCompactActivity class

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:54.857
from the package called
android.support.v7.ap.

00:00:54.857 --> 00:00:57.423
We don't have to worry about
how the internal details of how

00:00:57.423 --> 00:00:59.840
the AppCompactActivity or Bundle work.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.690
We can simply take advantage of them for
free in our code.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.819
Anytime we want to add
code from other packages,

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.110
we need to add more
import statements here.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.730
So in the quiz B is
the import statements.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.920
So next is a class declaration.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.435
So this public class line is
in the class declaration.

00:01:16.435 --> 00:01:19.575
It declares that this file contains
the definition of the class

00:01:19.575 --> 00:01:21.055
called MainActivity.

00:01:21.055 --> 00:01:24.015
It extends from a superclass
called the AppCompatActivity,

00:01:24.015 --> 00:01:27.935
which means it inherits all the
behaviors that AppCompatActivity has.

00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:31.700
So in terms of showing the window in
the device and showing the app bar.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.180
So we can also customize the behavior
by overwriting certain methods.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.500
We only modify this class declaration if
we want to change the name of the class

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.420
or change where we're inheriting from.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.620
And in the quiz,
C is the class declaration.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.600
So next is a method override.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.990
So here we are overriding
the onCreate method

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.390
that was originally defined in
the AppCompatActivity class.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.620
As a reminder, this onCreate
method is called by Android

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.080
when it first creates
an instance of a MainActivity.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.480
So right when you open
up an app on a device.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.630
And here we're providing our own steps
for what to do when the app is created.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.970
In the quiz, D is the method override.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.977
So lastly is the setContentView.

00:02:10.977 --> 00:02:15.708
Inside the onCreate method we have
a line that creates the setContentView

00:02:15.708 --> 00:02:20.630
method and passes in the activity_main
layout as an input argument.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.230
We're telling Android to put the UI
defined in this layout XML file

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.990
into this activity screen.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.159
And lastly in the quiz, E is set content
view to be an XML layout resource.
