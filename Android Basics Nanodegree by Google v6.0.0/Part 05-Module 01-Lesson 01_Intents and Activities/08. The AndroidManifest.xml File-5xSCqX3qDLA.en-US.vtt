00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.950
So we just saw the Android manifest
file for the first time and

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.580
even though it's an XML file,
it can be intimidating to look at

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.480
because it looks different
from the layout and

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.290
resource XML files that we've been used
to seeing in other parts of the app.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.239
So I think it might be helpful to
provide you some context for this file.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:21.200
So every app must have an Android
manifest.xml file with exactly that

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.620
name but luckily for us we don't
have to worry about creating one.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.150
So this file is automatically generated

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.160
whenever we create a new
app in Android Studio.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.170
You can think of this file as
a table of contents for your app.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.240
Let me explain.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.580
In a book like this, we have a table
of contents that helps summarize

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.400
what's contained inside the book.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.520
Similarly, the manifest file
summarizes the important information

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.105
about the whole app in a single place.

00:00:46.105 --> 00:00:49.065
When you install your app on a device,
the Android system

00:00:49.065 --> 00:00:52.315
first looks at this file before it
runs any of the code on your app.

00:00:52.315 --> 00:00:53.746
So, what is contained in this file?

00:00:53.746 --> 00:00:57.625
&gt;From the last exercise you notice that
all the activities to have to be listed

00:00:57.625 --> 00:00:59.066
in the Android manifest file.

00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:03.642
Well, this manifest also contains other
important information such as the Java

00:01:03.642 --> 00:01:08.182
package name which is the app's unique
identifier, components of the app, for

00:01:08.182 --> 00:01:12.511
example, the activity names, intents,
permissions for notifications or

00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:17.861
using the camera, and also it help sets
the minimum Android API, which means

00:01:17.861 --> 00:01:22.251
to specify which versions of the Android
platform the app is compatible on.

00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:26.511
So in the Android manifest file for our
Miwok app, here's the package name and

00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:28.147
these are the components of our app.

00:01:28.147 --> 00:01:30.971
This points to the theme of our app,
this is where

00:01:30.971 --> 00:01:34.861
the app theme from the styles.xml
file's applied to so that our app and

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:39.320
status bar will be brown, and
this is where our icon is specified.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.200
In the all apps screen of our device,
we see a basket as the app icon for

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.380
our Miwok app.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.820
Within the Miwok app,
we have five activities listed here.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.070
Within the MainActivity tag, we also
see something called an intent filter.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.020
Remember that an intent is a message
that requests some type of action to be

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.800
performed by another app.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.060
In turn, apps can specify intent
filters to announce to other apps, hey,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.730
I could receive a certain type of
intent and perform an action for you.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.220
This intent filter with
the action main and

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.100
category launcher indicates that
this is an entry point into our app.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.905
When a user taps on the Miwok app
icon in the device home screen,

00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:18.145
Android will send
an intent to start our app.

00:02:18.145 --> 00:02:21.465
This activity will receive that
intent and open up the screen.

00:02:21.465 --> 00:02:24.415
We'll have a chance to practice
modifying the Android manifest.xml

00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:27.395
later in this lesson but for
now let's go back to building our app.
