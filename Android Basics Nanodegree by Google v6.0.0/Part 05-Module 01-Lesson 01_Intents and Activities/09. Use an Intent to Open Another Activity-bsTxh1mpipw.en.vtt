00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.020
If you open up this tutorial site,

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.150
there's a lot of great
information about intents.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.870
We give you a hint to look at section
one dot two about starting activities.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.930
There's a nice diagram about one
activity opening another activity.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.290
The sample code also
looks pretty interesting.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.010
Assuming that this code is called
from within an activity file,

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.902
we create a new intent using a
constructor where we pass in two inputs.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.700
Here's the Android intent
documentation page and

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.270
this is the constructor we're calling.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.140
We need to pass in a context and
a cost component.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.080
All right, so back to the sample code.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.110
This first input needs to be
the context, so we pass in this.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.050
Which were first the current activity.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.410
In general, the context will help
the intent know more about the current

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.370
state of the app.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.980
So, that I can put the second activity
in front of the current activity and

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.020
later, the back button
on the device will work.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.800
The second input of this constructor is,
to take in a class component.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.210
This is the name of the activity we
want to open, which is activity two.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.100
We need the DOT class
extension at the end,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.810
to identify this specific Java class.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.050
The new intent is created and
stored in a variable called I.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.700
Then in this next line of code,
we call the start activity method and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.930
pass in the intent I as our input.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.420
So this allows Android to start
a new activity, called Activity two.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.300
Let's copy this code and
see if we can use it in our app.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.950
And, it looks like we get
an error in Android studio,

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.730
saying that it cannot resolve
the symbol, ActivityTwo.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.890
And that's because there is no activity
in our app called ActivityTwo.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.710
Let's rename it NumbersActivity,
which we do have in our app and

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.730
that seems to resolve all the errors.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.470
So let's go ahead and
run this on our device.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.570
Nice, it works.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.780
Now, we haven't formally
discussed what we just did though.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.480
So, let's unpack everything and
see what's actually what happened.
