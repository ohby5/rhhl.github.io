00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:04.389
Hey Jessica.

00:00:04.389 --> 00:00:05.870
&gt;&gt; Hey Catherine.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.090
&gt;&gt; I got these sketches from Andre,
do you want to check them out?

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:08.590
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:10.930
&gt;&gt; What do you think?

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.910
&gt;&gt; Wow, they look really good.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:13.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.149
&gt;&gt; Man, so I'm liking all of them.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.781
But maybe we shouldn't
use this first one here.

00:00:17.781 --> 00:00:19.140
&gt;&gt; Why not?
&gt;&gt; Well, in Android,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.216
we generally don't like
using splash screens,

00:00:21.216 --> 00:00:23.342
instead we jump directly
into the app content, so

00:00:23.342 --> 00:00:26.327
that the user doesn't have to wait for
the splash screen to load.

00:00:26.327 --> 00:00:27.489
&gt;&gt; Okay, how did you know that?

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.329
&gt;&gt; Well, it's covered in
the material design guidelines.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.439
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Canola and I totally
covered that in the last course.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.615
The students know that
spec front to back.

00:00:35.615 --> 00:00:39.430
But knowing the spec is different
from actually applying it.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.430
So I think we could really
use some design help.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.900
&gt;&gt; Actually I'm glad you bring that up.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.360
So I know this amazing
team of designers.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.520
So they can take our ideas,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.330
the features that we like, and
create some beautiful mocks for us.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.300
&gt;&gt; That sounds amazing.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so how about I'll
take these sketches to them.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.860
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; I'll get some mocks back and

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.683
meet with you later.

00:00:55.683 --> 00:00:56.566
&gt;&gt; Okay, thanks.

00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:57.270
&gt;&gt; All right, see you soon.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.470
&gt;&gt; So, when you first open the app,

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.849
we see a list of categories, numbers,
family members, colors, and phrases.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:09.210
If you click on the numbers category,
it shows a list of numbers.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.245
And for the number one,
we have the English and Miwok words,

00:01:13.245 --> 00:01:17.953
as well as an image and a button to
play the Miwok pronunciation aloud.

00:01:17.953 --> 00:01:22.520
And the same applies for the family,
colors, and phrases categories.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.320
So phrases, such as what's your name and
how are you feeling,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.020
don't really have an intuitive
image to go along with them.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.480
As a result,
we decided to show the English and

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.770
Miwok translations with the option
to play the sound as well.
