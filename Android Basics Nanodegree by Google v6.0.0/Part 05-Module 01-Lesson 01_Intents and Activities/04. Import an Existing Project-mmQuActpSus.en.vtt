00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.755
As an android developer,

00:00:01.755 --> 00:00:04.815
looking at code for an existing app is a critical skill to develop.

00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:06.449
If you join a team in the future,

00:00:06.449 --> 00:00:08.370
it's likely that you would work on an existing app,

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.810
instead of creating one from scratch.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.460
Some major projects may have hundreds of

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.205
files and you may not have time to read through all of them.

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:18.000
However, you can still get a high level idea by looking at the filenames,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.390
then looking closer at the files related to the work you need to do.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.740
So in this case,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.060
we currently have a small project,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.720
so in the quiz we asked you to look at each file and let's do that now together.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.960
So I'm going to start off by going over here to the "project",

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.175
changing this to the project view and when I look at the code base for the first time,

00:00:35.175 --> 00:00:38.730
I expand out the "Java" folder where all the logic of the app is.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.640
Then, I head over and expand out the "resource" folder,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.070
which has everything related to the appearance of the app.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.950
In the "Java" folder, we have one java file called

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.865
main activity and it turns out that main activity is the main screen of our app.

00:00:50.865 --> 00:00:53.340
Now we can move onto the app resource files,

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.365
located in the app/source/main/res directory.

00:00:58.365 --> 00:01:01.260
These files control how the app appears on different devices.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.320
Resources can include XML files,

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.450
images and other media files.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.865
We could start by expanding out the "layout" folder.

00:01:08.865 --> 00:01:12.855
Here we have the "activity_main.xml" file.

00:01:12.855 --> 00:01:15.840
This file defines the layout for the main screen of our app and it

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.810
contains a vertical linear layout with four text views.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.445
Then we have a mipmap folder,

00:01:20.445 --> 00:01:23.100
which is a special folder just for the app icon.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.400
Other images in your app should go in the Java folder.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.365
Then we have the values folder.

00:01:28.365 --> 00:01:30.780
This contains the "colors.xml" file,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.875
which defines the colors of our app,

00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:36.585
the app theme colors and the color associated with each category of the words.

00:01:36.585 --> 00:01:38.760
Next we have the "dimensions.xml" file,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.195
which contains dimensions, such as the width and height values for our app.

00:01:42.195 --> 00:01:44.310
It also contains the list item height,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.175
which we have here set to be 88dp.

00:01:47.175 --> 00:01:49.905
Moving down we have the "strings.xml" file.

00:01:49.905 --> 00:01:53.610
These are all the text strings that will appear to the user in the app and

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.260
we put them in a single file so that we can

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.495
easily translate the app into other languages.

00:01:57.495 --> 00:02:00.060
And lastly, we have the "styles.xml" file.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.205
Here we define the theme of the app and specify the theme colors.

00:02:03.205 --> 00:02:06.630
We also have the style for how a category should look and that's why

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.990
each category on the main screen of the app looks similar in terms of height,

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.330
padding, font size and more.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.150
So now let's move to the third task of the quiz,

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.400
which is to create a visual diagram of the different parts of

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.600
the app and everyone's diagram will be different which is a good thing.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.920
So here's one example that represents the big picture of the Miwok app code base.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.035
After reading all those files,

00:02:29.035 --> 00:02:30.400
maybe your takeaway was,

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.370
there a lot of resources that determine the appearance of

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.895
the app and a single java file for the logic of that.

00:02:36.895 --> 00:02:40.005
So here's another example of a diagram you could have drawn.

00:02:40.005 --> 00:02:42.180
We have an image of what the app looks like,

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.695
with the four categories and you label this as the "MainActivity.java" file.

00:02:46.695 --> 00:02:49.590
With an initation to the layout for this activity,

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.860
is defined in that "activity_main.xml" layout file.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.110
Then the theme of the app is defined in the "styles.xml" file.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.960
How a category item appears is also determined by

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.870
a style that is defined in the "styles.xml" file.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.100
The background color of the categories is defined in the "colors.xml" file,

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.955
while the category names are defined in the "strings.xml" file.

00:03:11.955 --> 00:03:16.250
Lastly, the list item height is defined at the "dimensions.xml" file.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.440
So regardless of how you chose to create a diagram of the app,

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.135
you just thought like a professional developer.

00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:24.330
And as we start to add more features,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.520
having a mental map of the app in our head,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.355
will help us figure out what parts of the app we would need to modify,

00:03:29.355 --> 00:03:31.365
to make these new features work properly.

00:03:31.365 --> 00:03:33.900
For example, if we receive a feature request from

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.555
our designer to change the layout of the main screen,

00:03:36.555 --> 00:03:41.185
we should head over to the "mainactivity_.xml" layout file.

00:03:41.185 --> 00:03:43.875
But the feature request is about changing the theme of the app,

00:03:43.875 --> 00:03:47.070
we should head over to the "styles.xml" file and if

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.070
we need to change how the app responds when you click on a view,

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.880
then we should look at the logic in the "MainActivity.java" file.
