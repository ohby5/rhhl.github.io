00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
Andrea, I'm so glad you reached out to me and could come today,

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.250
because I wanted to introduce you to Jessica.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.080
She's a course developer at Udacity,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.270
and she's going to be helping us build your app idea.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.280
Catherine's been telling me all about the app that you'd like to

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.435
make to help people learn about the Miwok language.

00:00:13.435 --> 00:00:14.915
Could you tell us more about that idea?

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:18.660
Sure. So, my family is as part of the Northern Sierra of Miwok tribe in

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.000
California and the language isn't

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.640
being passed down from generation to generation anymore.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.420
My great-grandmother was the last to speak the language fluently.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.145
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:30.585
So I'd like to preserve the language in the family,

00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:34.770
so I had an app idea that could teach my kids how to pronounce things like numbers,

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.135
and colors, and phrases.

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:38.175
Okay. So, that seems pretty straightforward.

00:00:38.175 --> 00:00:40.460
So the app would just be a list of words and

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.460
each word can have an English and a Miwok translation.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.050
That sounds reasonable for a student to build, right?

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.780
Yeah. That's assuming that they've taken the Android

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.060
for Beginners course with you and konoredi, right?

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.040
So they should already know how to build

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.760
a layout and how to make a simple but interactive app.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.720
Alright. So if the student watching doesn't feel comfortable with those concepts,

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.205
they should probably go back to that course,

00:00:59.205 --> 00:01:00.780
review those topics, and then come back.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.665
Yeah. And then we'll be building the Miwok app together with them.

00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:04.940
Yeah, that sounds doable.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.395
And this Apple Teach the dialect of Miwok that Andrea's tribe speaks.

00:01:08.395 --> 00:01:11.350
But our students can take this app and modify it to teach any language.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.330
That's so true. There's so many different languages that can be preserved by this.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.670
That's amazing if we could help other cultures.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.650
But by the way, how long is this gonna take?

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.125
Well, I'd estimate about four to six weeks,

00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:23.640
if we work alongside the students,

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.885
and then they pace themselves out.

00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:26.060
That sounds reasonable.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.855
I can't wait to show the app to my family.

00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:30.510
Yeah. And you know another reason why I'm so excited about

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.079
this app is because our students may feel like as a beginner,

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.175
you might not be able to create something that useful.

00:01:36.175 --> 00:01:39.490
But we're going to show them in this course that with their current skill set,

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.315
they can tackle real challenges in their community.

00:01:42.315 --> 00:01:44.250
That's right, such as preserving their local culture.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.150
Exactly.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.205
I completely agree, but to be honest

00:01:47.205 --> 00:01:49.310
I've never built an app before. Where do we even start?

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.430
Oh! That's okay.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.070
Actually, I have a really great idea.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.585
Let's ask our students for help.

00:01:53.585 --> 00:01:56.150
Alright. So, if Andrea can provide us a vocabulary list,

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.140
why don't you help us brainstorm how we can present

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.540
this information to a user within an app?

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.780
And take some time to think about this,

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.460
because a lot of people struggle with translating an idea into an actual app.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.460
So this will be good practice for you.
