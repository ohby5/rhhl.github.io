00:00:00.037 --> 00:00:03.640
Okay, so now we have a better
understanding of the main activity.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.130
Remember that you can think of
an activity as a single screener or app.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.610
By lesson five, we'll find out
that this isn't necessarily true.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.370
But for now this simplification is fine.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.393
In most apps you've built this far,
your app has had a single activity.

00:00:17.393 --> 00:00:21.453
Near the end of the Just Java app,
you added code that sent an intent to

00:00:21.453 --> 00:00:25.037
an email app to send an email
out with a coffee order summary.

00:00:25.037 --> 00:00:28.104
And then the Miwok App will
also be sending intents, but

00:00:28.104 --> 00:00:32.250
this time we're not launching into
other apps on Android device.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.310
Instead, we're sending intents to open
other activities that are created

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.730
within our Miwok App.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.780
So we should have five activities
in our app, the main activity

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.640
as well as an activity for
each of the four categories of words.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.260
When we click on a category
in the main activity,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.960
we'll send an intent to
open a new activity.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.940
That will eventually contain a list
of Miwok phrases for that category.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.380
To start off with,
all activities will be empty.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.540
But this activity will eventually
show the list of number words, and

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.200
this activity will show the list
of family member words and

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.820
etc., for colors and phrases.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.730
So let's work on creating these
four other activities in our app.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.700
I'll walk you through how to create
a new activity in Android Studio.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.960
Right-click on the package
in the project directory,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.328
go to New &gt; Activity &gt; Empty Activity.

00:01:17.328 --> 00:01:19.818
When the wizard pops up,
give the activity a name.

00:01:19.818 --> 00:01:22.442
In this case,
we will use NumbersActivity, and

00:01:22.442 --> 00:01:24.950
accept the default and click Finish.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.460
Now it's your turn to
create activities for

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.960
the remaining categories, phrases,
colors and family members.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.890
If you run the app on your device
there should be no errors.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.610
However, you won't be able to click
the category buttons to open these

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.870
activities until we add
more code in the next step.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.380
After you create each new activity,
navigate to the AndroidManifest.xml file

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.440
under the App Manifest folder
to observe how it's changed.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.830
Now, to recap what your tasks are,
first,

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.585
I'd like you to create the four
new activities in the Miwok app.

00:01:53.585 --> 00:01:55.240
So that would be the phrase activity,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.440
the numbers activity, the family
activity and the colors activity.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.750
And then next, go ahead and

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.870
navigate to the AndroidManifest.xml
file and then answer this question.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.630
So how does the AndroidManifest.xml file

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.180
change as you add more
activities to the app?

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.330
Now, I know this is a new file
that you haven't seen before, but

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.280
try to make an educated guess by
checking out the visual changes

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.750
that you see in that file, and
go ahead and write your answers here.
