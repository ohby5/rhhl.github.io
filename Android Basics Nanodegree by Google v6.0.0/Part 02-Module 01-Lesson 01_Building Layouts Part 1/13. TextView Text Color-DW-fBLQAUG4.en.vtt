00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.170
Okay.
So hopefully you picked some colors from

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.580
the Material Design Color Palette.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.550
I like this purple 500 color, so
I'm going to go ahead and copy it.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.900
And I'll go over to the code and

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.750
then change the background color
to be # and then the hex code.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.610
Then the background of the textview
updates to the purple color.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:20.992
Cool.

00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:22.550
Now let's change the text color and

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.620
I write android:textColor with
a capital C and then put double quotes.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.528
Okay so, then I'll go back
to the color guidelines and

00:00:30.528 --> 00:00:33.260
pick something like maybe
this yellow looks good.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.410
Over here and
then paste it in between the quotes.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.100
Oops, I forgot the pound sign, and
it says this color is not supported.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.390
So, I need to put
the hashtag symbol in first.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.890
Cool, and then we got yellow
text on a purple background.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.660
It looks pretty awesome to me.
