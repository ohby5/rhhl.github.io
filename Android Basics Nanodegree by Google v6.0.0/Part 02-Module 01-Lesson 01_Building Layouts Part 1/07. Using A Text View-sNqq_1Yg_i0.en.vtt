Thanks for your response,
there's no right or wrong answer here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.040
So let's talk about a couple of
observations that you may have made.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.670
First you may have seen that there's
these weird angle brackets at the start

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.485
and end of the code.

00:00:12.485 --> 00:00:15.215
There's also this weird forward slash.

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:18.035
But it only happens at the end and
not the beginning.

00:00:18.035 --> 00:00:19.665
And then it says TextView,

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:22.085
which we recognize because
we introduced it earlier.

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:26.505
And it's showing up in camel
case format, with the T and

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:28.160
the V capitalized.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.360
And then you might see
something about android: text.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.060
And the punctuation might be a little
weird here, to have a colon and

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.720
then a equal sign.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.950
Then we see something
that says Happy Birthday.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.440
And this is showing up like
exactly how we see on the phone.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.690
So somehow they may be related.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.197
So this can be an observation as well.

00:00:45.197 --> 00:00:50.338
Then we see something a background
thing some color that's darker, gray.

00:00:50.338 --> 00:00:53.339
And the TextView does
have gray background, so

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:55.070
this could also be linked.
