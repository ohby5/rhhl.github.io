00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.710
So, Katherine, we've been working
on this course for a while.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:03.560
&gt;&gt; I know, Kunal.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.270
And it's about to launch so
I'm really excited.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:05.780
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.279
It's been a couple of months that
we've been designing this course, and

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:09.546
I want to be in perfect synch with you.

00:00:09.546 --> 00:00:10.440
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.680
&gt;&gt; Around who the learner or
the student of this course is.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
So I think

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.220
the learner is someone who's
never programmed before.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.980
&gt;&gt; Wait.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.860
When you say never,
you mean no lines of code.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:21.520
&gt;&gt; Zero.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.510
&gt;&gt; Zero lines of code.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.613
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Wow that's going to

00:00:23.613 --> 00:00:26.483
be a tough course for us to design but
it's going to open up the gambit for

00:00:26.483 --> 00:00:27.833
everybody to take this course.

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:28.448
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:00:28.448 --> 00:00:30.210
I think that's why it's so powerful.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.800
because at the end of this course,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.170
I think they should be able to build
a couple of simple Android apps.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.440
&gt;&gt; Wait, let's backtrack a little bit.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.370
So, we're saying no lines of code,
no programming experience but

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.050
we're still saying you need a computer
and you need an internet connection.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and to have some familiarity
with using a computer and a smart phone.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.610
&gt;&gt; So you browse the internet let's
say on a smartphone or a computer?

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.020
&gt;&gt; Okay, well let's say this is where
the student is right now, right?

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.624
And this is where a professional
Android developer is, right?

00:00:55.624 --> 00:00:56.808
This is where they're making apps,

00:00:56.808 --> 00:00:59.220
they're making money,
they're changing the world.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.160
Let's say this is where we will
get them at the end of our course.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.550
&gt;&gt; I think we can get them to here.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.300
&gt;&gt; Okay, so in this journey that
the student is taking with us,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.440
what sort of apps
are they building here?

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.850
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so
the first app is a birthday card app.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.130
&gt;&gt; Wait, you said first app,
so there is more than one app?

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.292
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so first there's a birthday
card app, where they can make it for

00:01:18.292 --> 00:01:19.408
someone that they love.

00:01:19.408 --> 00:01:20.128
&gt;&gt; I like that.

00:01:20.128 --> 00:01:21.260
People have birthdays.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.683
Sometimes they even have half birthdays.

00:01:22.683 --> 00:01:23.924
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and

00:01:23.924 --> 00:01:27.110
the second app should be
a coffee ordering app.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.430
&gt;&gt; So you say, I want two cappuccinos,

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.110
and two cappuccinos appear
magically from the phone?

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.980
&gt;&gt; Not quite.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.580
But it captures what
the user wants to order and

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.150
then it sends it off in an email.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.810
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.005
So in this journey that we've been
sort of dreaming up, how long will it

00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:45.852
take the student so they can
budget their time appropriately?

00:01:45.852 --> 00:01:48.630
&gt;&gt; Hopefully, 20, 25 hours.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.720
&gt;&gt; I think that's about right.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.940
It'll take a lot of deliberate practice.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.580
They'll make a couple of fun apps.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.910
But what they can do is they
can take this 25 hours and

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.260
split this up into 4 or
5 weeks worth of their time.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that sounds good.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.200
&gt;&gt; So that's as much about
the course and about us.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.060
At this point,
I want to ask our students a question.
