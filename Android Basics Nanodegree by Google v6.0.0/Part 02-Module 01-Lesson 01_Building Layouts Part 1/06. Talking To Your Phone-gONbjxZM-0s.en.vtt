00:00:01.634 --> 00:00:03.920
Hey Kunal, what are you doing?

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.820
&gt;&gt; I just need a minute.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.060
&gt;&gt; What you writing.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.350
&gt;&gt; Well,
why are you looking at my email?

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.440
&gt;&gt; I just want to see what you doing.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.940
&gt;&gt; Okay fine.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.990
I'm sending an email to a friend to-
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.760
&gt;&gt; Which has instructions
on how to feed Chloe.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.040
&gt;&gt; Who's Chloe?

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.860
&gt;&gt; Chloe's my office plant.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.216
You name your office plant Chloe?

00:00:22.216 --> 00:00:24.489
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Chloe for chlorophyll.

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:25.370
&gt;&gt; Clever.
[LAUGH]

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.314
&gt;&gt; Look, here it is.

00:00:27.314 --> 00:00:28.026
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:28.026 --> 00:00:29.810
You know what this reminds me of?

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.920
&gt;&gt; What?

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.433
&gt;&gt; These instructions are similar
to how you write code to tell

00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:38.153
a computer what to do.

00:00:38.153 --> 00:00:42.285
&gt;&gt; Everything reminds you of how to
write instructions or code, Katherine.

00:00:42.285 --> 00:00:43.550
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; It does.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.490
But I'm serious.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.550
This time it does, it's sort of like.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.591
Like here, this line where
you're saying that you need to

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:52.401
water the plant exactly
on Tuesday at 10 o'clock.

00:00:52.401 --> 00:00:54.798
&gt;&gt; Right, so when I'm giving specific
instructions on Tuesdays and

00:00:54.798 --> 00:00:55.960
Thursdays water the plant.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.520
Or make sure the water is lukewarm.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.780
Those specific instructions
are like writing code.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.315
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:01:00.315 --> 00:01:00.976
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And you know how

00:01:00.976 --> 00:01:02.698
you're writing this
letter in an email app?

00:01:02.698 --> 00:01:04.129
&gt;&gt; Yeah I'm using Gmail.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:04.739
&gt;&gt; Good choice.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.417
We also need a space to write our code.

00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:10.484
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:01:10.484 --> 00:01:12.700
&gt;&gt; And that space is called an IDE.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.800
&gt;&gt; What does that stand for?

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.230
&gt;&gt; It stands for
Integrated Development Environment.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.314
&gt;&gt; I am more confused after listening to
the full form of that acronym when I was

00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:21.400
when I heard the acronym.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.040
&gt;&gt; Well,
don't worry about what it stands for.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.550
In Android, all you need to know is
that we're going to use Android Studio.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.620
&gt;&gt; Is that on this computer?

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.140
That software?

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.045
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's right here,
let me show you.

00:01:32.045 --> 00:01:33.213
&gt;&gt; And this is what it looks like.

00:01:33.213 --> 00:01:34.174
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:34.174 --> 00:01:36.910
&gt;&gt; You know, I must admit that this
looks a little bit intimidating.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.590
It has a lot of buttons on it.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.370
&gt;&gt; It is, there's a lot of things
going on but we'll get there.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.631
By the end of the course, the students
will know how to operate this.

00:01:44.631 --> 00:01:45.816
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay, good.

00:01:45.816 --> 00:01:47.164
&gt;&gt; Cool, so back to your letter.

00:01:47.164 --> 00:01:48.230
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.650
&gt;&gt; You know how you're using
English to write this letter?

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.060
&gt;&gt; Well that's a great observation.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.760
I thought you said you were not reading
my email, but yes, I am using English.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.790
&gt;&gt; Okay.
Well, we have to use a certain

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.420
language to talk to the computer,
to give it instructions.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.340
&gt;&gt; What are we using?

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.470
&gt;&gt; We're going to start with XML.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.133
You know, Katherine, you're a fan of
three lettered acronyms, it seems.

00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:10.090
[LAUGHS].
First IDE, now XML.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.890
What does XML stand for?

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.550
&gt;&gt; It stands for
Extensible Markup Language.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.860
&gt;&gt; Extensible Markup Language?

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.275
What does Extensible ML do?

00:02:19.275 --> 00:02:22.430
&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]
&gt;&gt; It is a way to describe how your

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.640
Android app is going to look.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.570
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So we can use it to build layouts.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.160
&gt;&gt; Okay, so
where are you going to place things,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.460
what things you're going
to place on the phone.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.030
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.790
&gt;&gt; Okay, well there's a lot
going on in this video so

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.520
let's just do a quick recap.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.560
We're talking about how writing
code is like writing instructions.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.213
Really specific instructions.

00:02:37.213 --> 00:02:37.750
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.200
We're also talking about how we need
a space in which to write that code.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.160
&gt;&gt; And
that space will be Android Studio.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.410
&gt;&gt; And we also identified the
programming language we will be using.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.600
&gt;&gt; Which is XML.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.870
&gt;&gt; So let's write our first line of XML.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:50.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
