00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.410
Okay, I'm going to choose
a really big font, and

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.900
then I'll try a really small font.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.640
So I picked display three here,
which is 56sp.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.390
And remember to, add an attribute
before the tag is closed.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.610
So I'll hit enter here and
then add textSize attribute.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.360
Cool.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.370
And then the text is giant over here.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.420
Now I can try a smaller size,
of maybe some body text

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.310
which would be 14 SP,
so I'll erase this and

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:39.960
then say 14, and
then it's tiny again, cool.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.040
Okay, so we finished the first task.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.472
The optional challenge was to try
learning about the text appearance

00:00:45.472 --> 00:00:49.850
attribute on your own from the Google
Plus protip that I included a link to.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.480
Let's open that up now.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.580
So, this is an Android dev protip
that was written by yours truly, for

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.100
the Android developers Google Plus page.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.640
If you haven't already,
you can follow the Google Plus page for

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.989
Android developers, to get the latest
news on Android development.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.900
Or if you'd prefer Twitter,
you can follow our account there.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.040
So basically in this short pro tip,
I talk about

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.840
again how too many font sizes can be
visually distracting for your user.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.930
So you can use the recommended font
sizes in the Material Design spec, or

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.970
you can also choose from a standard set
of type sizes, provided by Android,

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.370
which is small, medium and large.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.650
So instead of text size, you said
the Android TextAppearance attribute

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.020
to be androidTextAppearanceLarge,
or you can set small or medium.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.380
These TextAppearance values
map to these SP font sizes.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.390
So with these ever changing Android

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.090
then your code will
automatically get the new value.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.190
Using text appearance is grea,t because
you don't have to worry about specific

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.940
SP values, and

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.190
you can still be consistent
with other apps on the device.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.530
For example, for
a title you can use large, for

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.160
a list item you can use medium, or
for a caption you can use small.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.090
So these are good buckets to work with.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.170
You can try the mat in our code
by copying this line here.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.600
You can use cmd+Ccor you can use
ctrl+c if you're on a Windows machine.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.000
Go over to our code here.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.450
I'm going to delete this text size line,

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.780
because we're going to
add text appearance.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.890
Hit command V or control V.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.900
So now android text appearance
is text appearance large.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.510
And you can see that the preview has
updated to have the larger font size.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.860
That's pretty neat, right?

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.150
And you can also change
this to be medium or small.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.100
So in general,
this is really useful to know,

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.930
if you don't want to
declare specific SP values.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.090
So if you have no idea which
SP values you want to use,

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.870
you can just pick from small,
medium, large.
