00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.500
The answer to the first question is that
the XML element name is here, TextView.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.180
It follows the open angle bracket.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.195
Then, all the attributes are below
the XML element name, and

00:00:13.195 --> 00:00:15.750
I've underlined
the attribute names here.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.960
They're on the left hand
side of the equal sign.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.180
They include android:text,
android:textColor, and so on.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.440
If you put the attribute values, like
Happy Birthday or the color/white or

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.870
black, that's incorrect, because
those are the attribute values, and

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.450
it's asking for the names.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.540
The last question is,
on what line number is a tag closed?

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.020
Then we see the forward slash and

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.960
the closing angle bracket on
the last line, which is line 6.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.150
This means that it's a self-closing tag,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.920
because we open the text view tag
here and then we close it right away.
