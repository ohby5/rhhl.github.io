00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.358
So the quiz said to change the width and
the height to be wrap content.

00:00:03.358 --> 00:00:07.258
Now these device don't have to
match every single time, so

00:00:07.258 --> 00:00:12.329
I can set one to be wrap content and the
other to be a fixed value like 150dp.

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:14.740
And then you see it update here.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.200
And then we see that happily
the text view size has now shrunk to

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.220
fit the content inside of it.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.010
So, its only as wide and tall as
the happy birthday text inside of it.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.610
Great.
So

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.590
now the second part of the quiz
was to change the text that it's

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.670
a lot longer than just one line of text.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.530
We want it to go to two lines
of text on the device here.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.080
Let's change the text inside
that quotation marks here.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.326
I'm going to pick
the Happy Birthday song.

00:00:42.326 --> 00:00:48.714
So happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you,

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:55.571
happy birthday dear Jennie,
happy birthday to you.

00:00:55.571 --> 00:00:58.396
Jennie's our teammate,
who keeps us on track and

00:00:58.396 --> 00:01:01.771
makes sure that we're shipping
this course to you on time.

00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:04.206
Okay, so
now we see that the text view, and

00:01:04.206 --> 00:01:08.610
just marked by this great background,
has now expanded in height because now

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.450
there's more text inside
of this text view.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.360
That's pretty cool.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.480
It did that automatically without
having to change the width manually.
