00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.960
Tell us about a time when you
were learning something new and

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.490
you had to struggle.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.190
&gt;&gt; Okay, Katherine, if you're
going to ask our students to share

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.870
their vulnerable stories
on the Internet.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; We have to lead by example.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.280
&gt;&gt; Okay, fair enough.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.230
You go first.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.870
&gt;&gt; Okay.
[LAUGH] Well I've been

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.180
learning to play the piano for
about eight months.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:18.890
&gt;&gt; Oh okay.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.936
&gt;&gt; And the toughest bits for
me have been getting one hand right and

00:00:21.936 --> 00:00:25.747
then getting the right hand right and
then putting those two things together.

00:00:25.747 --> 00:00:30.309
But, when it comes out just so
beautiful its like [SOUND].

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:31.203
&gt;&gt; Oh, that sounds really good.

00:00:31.203 --> 00:00:34.082
&gt;&gt; I've been playing with my friends,
it's really fun.

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:35.986
&gt;&gt; Wait, you haven't played for me.

00:00:35.986 --> 00:00:38.249
&gt;&gt; Well, we'll see if we stay
friends till the end of this course

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:39.446
&gt;&gt; Okay, then.

00:00:39.446 --> 00:00:40.269
&gt;&gt; Your turn.

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:43.672
&gt;&gt; I've struggled with learning
Chinese my whole life.

00:00:43.672 --> 00:00:45.390
&gt;&gt; Wait, you speak Chinese?

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.447
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:46.447 --> 00:00:50.696
[FOREIGN]
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:00:50.696 --> 00:00:51.370
&gt;&gt; It's no big deal.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.236
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So, I think the hardest part of

00:00:54.236 --> 00:00:57.368
learning Chinese has been trying
to learn all the vocab words and

00:00:57.368 --> 00:01:01.380
trying to put them together in complete
sentences without tripping up.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.060
&gt;&gt; You know this story of
yours is reminding me that

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.180
learning how to make an Android app
is like learning a new language.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.790
Okay, I could see that.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.380
&gt;&gt; So, you're learning a new vocabulary,
and you're putting those things

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.105
together, and programming sentences,
and creating an app.

00:01:14.105 --> 00:01:15.110
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.960
&gt;&gt; Okay, well those are our stories.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.390
Now I want our students to
share their vulnerable stories.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.190
Tell us about a time when you learned
something new and it was a struggle.
