Hey, what's up?

00:00:02.055 --> 00:00:05.171
[SOUND] Congrats on completing
your first few lessons of Android

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:05.941
development.

00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:09.242
You've taken a really big step here,
as one of the major hurdles in learning

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:11.215
something new is just
simply getting going.

00:00:11.215 --> 00:00:13.695
We know it can be challenging and
perhaps intimidating and

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:15.560
you just tackled that milestone.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.520
So kudos, the neat thing now,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.830
is you possess the skills to
make a single screen app.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.580
Go tackle this project head on,
and make it your own.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.960
I'm looking forward to
seeing what you create.
