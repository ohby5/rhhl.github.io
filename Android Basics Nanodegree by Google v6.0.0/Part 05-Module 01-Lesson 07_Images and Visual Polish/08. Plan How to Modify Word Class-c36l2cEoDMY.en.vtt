00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.660
So currently the work class contains
two string variables, one for

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.910
the default translation and
one for the Miwok translation.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.140
And both of these variables are private,
but we have public methods

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.720
that other classes can call to get
access to the state of the object.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.340
So now to add support for
images, we're going to need to

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.430
add a new variable to keep track of the
image associated with each word object.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.716
Well what should the data
type of this new variable be?

00:00:26.716 --> 00:00:30.627
Well we could store the actual image but
that actually takes up a lot of

00:00:30.627 --> 00:00:34.640
memory because all our illustrations
are not trivial in size.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.170
Plus for

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.570
a really long list of words, if we
ever scroll to the bottom of the list.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.840
It would be a waste to store
each image in the word list

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.780
if the images have strolled off screen.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.910
Plus it would blot the amount of memory
resources that the word list would use.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.040
Now, a more efficient way is to just
store the resource ID for each image.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.859
A resource ID something like
R.drawable.number_one is

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:59.697
actually an integer.

00:00:59.697 --> 00:01:01.974
So instead of storing an actual image,

00:01:01.974 --> 00:01:05.780
we just store the name of the resource
so that we can find it later.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.070
So we can think of that
situation like an address book.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.890
You don't need to store someone's
whole house into your address book.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.210
Instead you can just store
someone's mailing address.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.550
And in case you need it later.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.050
You can look up that mailing address and
go find their house.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.670
So back to our situation,
when the list view asked for

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.070
a list item layout for this word.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.287
It's the word adapter's responsibility
to return the resource ID, so

00:01:31.287 --> 00:01:33.994
something like R.drawable.number_one.

00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:37.721
And turn it into an actual image of
an acorn that will be displayed onto

00:01:37.721 --> 00:01:39.310
the screen.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.940
So we see here that each word class
holds two strings and one integer for

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.830
the image resource ID.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.100
So to follow the convention for

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.580
the other variables in this class,
we want these state variables

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.840
to be declared with the private
access modifier and not public.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.558
So this means that only methods
within this class can access these

00:01:59.558 --> 00:02:01.114
private variables.

00:02:01.114 --> 00:02:04.802
So, we can trust that methods within
this class will modify the image

00:02:04.802 --> 00:02:06.710
resource ID properly.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.060
We don't want the variable to be public,
because other classes

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.520
could change the image resource ID into
something invalid, which would cause our

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.760
app to crash when we try to translate
the resource ID into an actual image.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.120
Now back to the first
question of the quiz

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.340
which asked what additional state
what a word object contain?

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.790
Well we'll need a private integer
variable for the image resource ID.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.740
And since this variable's private,
we need a public method so

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.130
that other classes can access the image
associated with this word object.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.260
And by the way,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.040
only create public access modifiers
to access private variables.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.950
If you intend for
other classes to need those methods.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.810
If we created additional variables for

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.020
ourselves to manage
the word object internally.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.320
They don't need to be external facing.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.090
We don't need to create
public get methods

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.450
to expose those variables
to outside callers.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.720
So back to the second question
of the quiz that asked,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.620
what additional method should we have?

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.330
We would need a public method
called getImageResourceId

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.450
to return the integer image resource ID.
