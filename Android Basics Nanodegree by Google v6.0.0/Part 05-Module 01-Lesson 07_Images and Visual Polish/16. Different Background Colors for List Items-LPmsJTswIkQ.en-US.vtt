00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.610
So I want to pass in a color
into the word adapter so

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.890
all the words in that category
have the same background color.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.227
So to do this I will need to modify
the word adapter to hold our color

00:00:10.227 --> 00:00:11.148
resource value.

00:00:11.148 --> 00:00:20.428
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:20.428 --> 00:00:25.195
And now I'll need a modifier existing
constructor to accept this new

00:00:25.195 --> 00:00:29.958
color resource ID as an input, and
now I need to set the value of m color

00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:34.910
resource ID to be whatever input was
passed in as the color resource ID.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.620
And then at the bottom of the give
you method I need to set the color.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.940
So that's done with this
block of code here.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.870
So first I'm setting
the theme of the color for

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.930
the lists item and then I'm finding he
color that the resource ID maps to and

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.680
then finally set in the background
color of the text container view.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.280
I know colors can be a bit tricky and

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.420
it did take me a couple
tries to get this right.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.640
But follow along and you'll be able to
do something similar in your own app.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.620
So now, we need a convert the color
resource ID into a color value.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.705
To do this, let's head on over
to the list item way out.

00:01:07.705 --> 00:01:11.430
In here we need to make sure that the
linear layout in the list item layout

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.510
has an ID on the container.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.270
So back to the word adapter.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.030
So now that we have the word adapter
constructor set up to take in the color

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.760
resource ID, we need to modify
the other activities so

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.990
that when we call the word
adopt a constructor.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.020
We're passing the right inputs.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.011
So we that here in the numbers activity.

00:01:28.011 --> 00:01:30.999
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:36.307
I want to add that here in the colors
activity, and similarly for

00:01:36.307 --> 00:01:41.140
the phrases activity and
lastly for the family activity.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.770
And one more thing before I forget.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.212
So back on the list item layout,
remember to remove the background color

00:01:49.212 --> 00:01:51.400
that we hard coded
into list item layout.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.190
So we had set it to always appear as an
orange background color behind the text,

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.250
but now that we can set the color
dynamically when the list items created

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.050
we don't need it any more.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.880
So let's test out the app now.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.840
So let's start with numbers.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.090
All right orange is expected and
then family members, whoa.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.750
That looks really good.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.130
So going back to the colors nice and

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.530
then lastly phrases
while liking that blue.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.630
So each category shows a different color
as expected and it's all coming together

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.590
and looking really polished now,
so high five on that great job.
