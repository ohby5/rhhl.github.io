00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.830
So for the question of where to store
the background color information.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.580
We could have stored the background
color in the Word object.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.380
So that means for all number words

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.480
we could pass in the orange color
as an input in the constructor.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.830
But that would be a lot of wasted memory
because we're remembering the same color

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.780
for all the words in the same category.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.340
If we want to reduce the amount of
repeated information in our app,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.460
the more appropriate place is
to store the color information

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.410
in the WordAdapter class.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.650
So each activity has its own
list view and WordAdapter.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.390
So for each WordAdapter,
we can store a color inside it,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.510
according to the category
it was created for.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.062
So as I wrote here, we can store
the background color information in

00:00:43.062 --> 00:00:46.660
the WordAdapter, so every time a new
WordAdapter object is created for

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.050
a certain list, it will apply the same
background color to all list items.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.450
So following this logic,

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.410
the WordAdapter in the numbers
activity would store the orange color.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.030
The WordAdapter in the family activity
would hold the green color and so on.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.224
Well, you may be wondering why don't
we just store it in the activity then?

00:01:05.224 --> 00:01:08.210
Because each activity
has a different color.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.430
Well, the activity does
need to know the color but

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.550
only when we initialize the WordAdapter.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.840
So ultimately,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.370
the WordAdapter has to store the color
as a global variable so that it can

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.810
keep referring back to the color every
time it creates a new list item layout.
