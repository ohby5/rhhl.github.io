00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.102
So how should we modify the code, so

00:00:02.102 --> 00:00:05.840
that list items have different
background colors based on the category.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.170
I'd like you to take a moment
to think about your mental model

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.200
of the Miwok app code base.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.930
Where could the background
color information be stored?

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.860
Well, we could store it
in all of these files.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.400
However, that would be an inefficient
use of memory resources.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.720
Remember that every variable
takes up space in memory.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.020
So to be a good citizen in Android,
we should minimize the memory usage and

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.800
store it in the minimal number
of places where it's needed.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.930
So this also minimizes the amount of
places that know about this color.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.714
So should we show the color as
a variable inside the Word class?

00:00:38.714 --> 00:00:39.600
Or maybe inside the WordAdapter class?

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.240
Or maybe inside each
individual activity?

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.420
So take a look at the screenshots below
and try to make your best educated guess

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.470
out of these three choices and
then explain your reasoning below.
