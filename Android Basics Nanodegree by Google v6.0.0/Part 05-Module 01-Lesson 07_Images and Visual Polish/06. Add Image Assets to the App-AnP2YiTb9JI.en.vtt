Awesome, now your app has multiple
versions of each trouble resources

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.660
separated by their image densities and

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.261
this is what it should look
like in Android Studio.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.890
Let's review how you made that happen.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.510
First we follow the link
to the GitHub Repo and

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.120
then click the download ZIP button.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.110
Next to extract the zip folder and

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.138
I just extracted it directly
to the Downloads folder.

00:00:22.138 --> 00:00:24.640
But you could also extract
it to your desktop or

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.250
another folder as long as
you know where it's going.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.962
Now with that done we'll
navigate into the folder and

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:34.687
highlight these subfolders
to be copied and pasted.

00:00:34.687 --> 00:00:37.650
So I'm going to right-click and Copy.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.085
Now let's navigate
back to Android Studio.

00:00:41.085 --> 00:00:45.286
As you a note here, I'm taking a look
at the project in my Project view.

00:00:45.286 --> 00:00:49.521
I'm going to navigate to the res
directory and then right-click and

00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:52.750
Paste in the five folders
that I just copied.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.680
So I'm going to click OK here.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.130
Once all the folders are copied over,
we can click them open and

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.500
take a look at any of the images.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.160
So here in Android Studio we
see a preview of the image and

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.670
in the top right corner we can also see
the size of the image in pixels as well.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.165
Now before we move on,

00:01:10.165 --> 00:01:14.065
let's make sure the app still runs
with all these new files included.

00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:17.055
So here's my device with this
version of the app running.

00:01:17.055 --> 00:01:18.702
Let's navigate into Numbers.

00:01:18.702 --> 00:01:19.889
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:22.025
And good, so
it looks like it's still working.

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:24.835
Now our next task will be to get
the images to show onto the screen.
