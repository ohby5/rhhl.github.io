00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.930
&gt;From browsing through
the images in the GitHub repo.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.610
We wanted you to try your best
to answer these two questions.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.620
And don't worry if you didn't get
these answers on the first try.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.520
So first, why are there
different drawable folders?

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.173
You may have noticed we had
the drawable-mdpi folder,

00:00:17.173 --> 00:00:22.380
the drawable-hdpi folder,
the drawable-xhdpi folder, and so on.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.610
Each folder represents
a different resolution device.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.050
So remember, resolution means how
many pixels are on the screen.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.310
So some of the earlier devices
don't have as many pixels.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.770
While the more recent devices
have a ton of pixels on screens,

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.220
to make the images much sharper.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.690
So to accommodate for those differences,
we have the MDPI folder for

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.310
medium density devices, the HDPI
folder for high density devices,

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.690
and even the XXXHDPI folder, for the
extra-extra-extra high density devices.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.020
So the second question is, why there
are multiple versions of the same image?

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.459
Well, depending on
the resolution of the device

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.110
we'll show the image from
the appropriate Java folder.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.410
That way the image always looks
sharp and crisp on the device.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.310
So, I'm sure you have a lot
of unanswered questions

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.140
as to why the images
are structured this way.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.340
And don't worry about it.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.380
This is definitely expected.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.570
We'll go more into detail about
these answers in the next video.
