00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.305
So now that we've planned how
we'll modify the Word class,

00:00:03.305 --> 00:00:06.700
I'd like you to go ahead and
make those changes in your app now.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.720
And as a note, there's no need
to change the Word constructor

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.020
until our next coding exercise.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.010
To make use of the new image
resource in our Word class,

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.040
you'll notice that we'll need
to modify the constructor.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.654
But don't worry about modifying
the constructor just yet.

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:23.085
We'll get to that in
the next coding exercise and

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:24.694
walk you through how to do that.

00:00:24.694 --> 00:00:28.182
For this exercise, I'd like you
to just add the new variable and

00:00:28.182 --> 00:00:30.185
new method to the Word class for now,

00:00:30.185 --> 00:00:34.270
and make sure the app still runs on
your device after those changes.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.370
And go ahead and
check this box when you're done.
