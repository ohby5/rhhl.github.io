00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.050
Jessica.
&gt;&gt; Hm?

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.200
We need to talk.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:02.900
&gt;&gt; What?
What's up?

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.510
&gt;&gt; We've been hand-holding them way
too much, and it has got to stop.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.300
&gt;&gt; What?
&gt;&gt; Okay,

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.760
we've been in the kiddie pool for
way too long.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.420
We've been giving them
all these instructions,

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.470
telling them what to do next.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.030
But then when they're out in the real
world working on their own project,

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.020
they're going to get stuck.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.110
They're not going to
know what to do next.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.140
And when they're in the deep end,
they might drown.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.850
You don't want them to drown, right?

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.590
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's super extreme.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.930
All right, so let's compromise.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.192
So how bout for the next feature of
adding images to the app we'll help them

00:00:30.192 --> 00:00:34.748
by thinking of strategies to execute and
then what orders to execute those in.

00:00:34.748 --> 00:00:35.510
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.720
I could see that working out.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.510
But no more hand holding after that.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.650
&gt;&gt; All right, so we've come to a key
point in every developer's workflow.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.890
The app is functioning and it tells the
users about the Miwok translations for

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.210
the English words.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.590
Now a feature request has come in to add
images to the app, and we discussed it

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.890
with our designer, and this is what
we'd like the app to look like.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.720
So if you're on a team it's common for

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.620
you as a developer to take on a single
feature, like adding images to the app.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.860
It's also common for a Program Manager
or Tech Lead of your team to ask you for

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.160
a time estimate of how long it'll
take you to build out a feature.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.460
So I won't ask you for a time estimate.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.650
But I do want you to estimate
the scope of your work.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.010
So at a high level, what changes
to the app needs to be made?

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.950
So you may be thinking,
I understand what we need to achieve and

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.110
why, but I'm not sure
the next steps to get there.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.240
And I'm not even sure how to
determine the scope of the work.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.990
Well all those thoughts
are perfectly normal and

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.110
that's why we're here to help.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.090
So one of the first things we can
do to plan is to make sure we have

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.080
a mental map of our code base.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.130
And review how everything fits together.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.060
So you may have noticed,
our code has gotten quite complex.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.780
There's multiple layout files,
a few Java files, and

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.940
a couple more resources as well.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.300
So using a mental model, we can peer
into our code and anticipate and

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.600
visualize all the medications
that we'll need to make

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.550
to the different parts of the code base.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.690
Depending on the feature it could
mean affecting many different files.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.660
So having a mental map
will help us anticipate

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.839
where we'll need to make changes.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.800
So let's revisit our mental
diagram from lesson one.

00:02:17.458 --> 00:02:21.200
We filled out a lot more
features since then, and

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.140
we've made some modifications
to it slightly.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.410
Now there's no rules for
how to create a proper mental model

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.050
as long as you can keep track of
all the major parts of the app.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.600
So since the app is getting more
complex we can zoom out a bit,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.830
meaning we don't have to include all
the details that we originally had.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.230
So we know that they're still there but
they're just not at the top of our mind.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.834
So currently this is
a model of our app flow so

00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:53.116
tapping on each category takes
us to the appropriate activity.

00:02:53.116 --> 00:02:56.207
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:02:56.207 --> 00:02:59.070
We've also taken a look at
how each activity, gets and

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.820
displays the appropriate data.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.930
So let's focus in on
the numbers activity.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.310
We store data in word
objects inside an array list.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.880
And retrieved and
display that information

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.710
in each list item using the list
view and array adapter combination.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.280
So in the next node you'll see
the two diagrams of our current mental

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.859
model of the app.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.000
So to help us scope out our new
feature of adding images to each word,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.890
what changes will we need to make
to each of the two diagrams?

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.210
Now assume that the phrases activity
will not be showing images,

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.969
and will be a special case
that will be handled later.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.600
So ignore that difference for now.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.810
Now remember this is a thought
exercise to help you began planning

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.770
how you'll build out your next feature.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.590
So there's no right or wrong answer.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.620
And when you're done,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.110
I'd like you check this box when you've
sketched out your potential solutions.
