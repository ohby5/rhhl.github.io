00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:00.870
All right, great.

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.410
So that takes care of our first change.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.689
So this is perfect timing.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:07.480
Because I have great news for you.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.110
Our designer has just finished
the assets of our app, so

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.650
we can go ahead and
add them to our project now.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.867
And by the way I use the term asset
to refer to the images the designer

00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:18.007
provided for us.

00:00:18.007 --> 00:00:23.347
An asset can refer to photos,
logos, illustrations,

00:00:23.347 --> 00:00:27.106
media files, or even text documents.

00:00:27.106 --> 00:00:31.077
But in this case, we're referring
to the illustrations of Mewok app.

00:00:31.077 --> 00:00:33.361
Now you may hear the term asset drop,

00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:37.644
which means that the designer is
handing over a group of assets to us.

00:00:37.644 --> 00:00:41.046
Even if our designer hadn't
given the illustrations to us,

00:00:41.046 --> 00:00:45.400
note that we wouldn't be completely
blocked waiting for them.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.930
We could still make
progress on steps three and

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.560
four by using placeholder data.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.500
So it's important for
us to get along as far as we can,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.680
even if we don't have everything
needed to finish the job.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.590
All right, there are a lot of
images in that asset drop.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.860
So let's take a look at
the files that were received.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.090
I'd like you to follow along.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.270
Go ahead and pause the video and
click on this Downloads It button.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.890
So once that whole ZIP file has
downloaded onto your computer,

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.870
I'd like you to go ahead and
click open the Assets folder.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.623
So, inside we see five
different folders.

00:01:16.623 --> 00:01:20.264
So drawable HDPI, MDPI,

00:01:20.264 --> 00:01:24.402
XHDPI, XXHDPI and XXXHDPI.

00:01:24.402 --> 00:01:28.515
So let's click open each one and
explore around.

00:01:28.515 --> 00:01:31.055
So clicking open this HDPI one, whoa!

00:01:31.055 --> 00:01:32.445
We see there's a bunch of images here.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.410
So, how about I click open
the family daughter image.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.080
So, clicking it open
shows a preview of it.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.360
So, that brings up the question: what
are all these other folders for?

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.310
How about I click open
this triple x one.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.840
So, clicking the family daughter
image underneath the XXXHDPI folder

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.260
shows the same family daughter image,
but it's much larger this time.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.630
So why do you think our designer gave us
multiple versions of the same icon, but

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.510
at different sizes?

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.125
So for this next exercise, I'd like it
you to browse through the files and

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:07.225
folders from our designer.

00:02:08.245 --> 00:02:10.163
The link to the assets
is in the notes below.

00:02:11.435 --> 00:02:14.105
And then I'd like you to try
to answer these questions.

00:02:14.105 --> 00:02:16.525
Why are there different
draw-able folders?

00:02:16.525 --> 00:02:18.647
And, why are there multiple versions
versions of the same image.

00:02:19.977 --> 00:02:22.867
So make some observations and
guesses about what is happening.

00:02:23.975 --> 00:02:26.287
I know we haven't covered
these topics yet, so

00:02:26.287 --> 00:02:28.637
try to answer these questions
as best as you can.
