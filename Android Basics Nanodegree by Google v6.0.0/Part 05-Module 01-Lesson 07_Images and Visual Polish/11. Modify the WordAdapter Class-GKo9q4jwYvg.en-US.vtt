00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.840
All right, so
we finished three out of the four items.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.640
We have a list of word objects where
each word is associated with an image.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.360
We have included all
the images in the app, and

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.140
we've updated list item layout
to include an image view.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.000
So now for task 4, we need to modify
the instructions in the WordAdapter.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.720
The WordAdapter is responsible for

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.180
loading the right information from the
word object into the list item layout,

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.070
and this includes loading the right
image into the image view.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.000
So going into our WordAdapter class,
let's zero in on the getView method.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.010
Remember that this method gets called
when the list view is trying to

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.850
display a list of items
at a given position.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.750
So the list view will pass in
a potential view that we could reuse.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.110
And here it's called convertView.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.380
And the last input here refers
to the parent view group for

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.920
all these list items which
is the ListView itself.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.980
Now the purpose of the getView method
is to return a list item view and

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.470
return it to the list view.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.970
So the section of code here
helps us inflate the view.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.810
So we inflate the list item view,
meaning that we create a new list item

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.470
layout from this XML resource list_item.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.790
And we're going to soar this in
the list item view variable.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.260
I'm going to jump over toward
this XML resources are cleared.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.360
By right clicking going to Go to and
then Declaration.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.470
So here in the XML resource,
we see that though it's a single view,

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.990
it's referencing the linear
layout at the root of the layout.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.820
Well, from this view we can find
the child views and modify them.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.570
Now back to the WordAdapter.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.430
This line of code here helps
us get the word object

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.240
at the given position in the list.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.250
And then in this next section of code.,

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.887
we find the child text view with
the ID miwork_ text_view and

00:01:49.887 --> 00:01:53.290
set the miwork translation of
the word on to that text view.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.935
And then repeat the same steps for
the text view with ID default_text_view.

00:01:59.935 --> 00:02:03.970
And set the English translation of
the word on to the text view here.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.065
And lastly since we've added an image
view to our list item layout,

00:02:07.065 --> 00:02:10.350
we'll need to make sure our
adapters aware of that, too.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.470
For the next coding task, go ahead and
modify the WordAdapter's get view

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.060
method, so it sets the right image into
ImageView of the list item layout.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.870
And as a hint, refer to the Android
flavor app as an example.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.248
As a hint, you can refer to the Android
flavor app from the last lesson if

00:02:27.248 --> 00:02:28.040
that helps.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.600
So this app remember
displays an image for

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.500
the corresponding Android
release in each list item.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.480
So this is what the new walk app
should look like when you're done.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.440
So notice that there's a problem
with the phrases activity, but

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.870
we're going to fix that
in a later code step.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.690
So don't worry about that for this task.
