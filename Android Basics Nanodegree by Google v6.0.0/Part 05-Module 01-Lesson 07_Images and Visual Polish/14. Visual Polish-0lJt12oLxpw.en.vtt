00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.870
All right.
Now on to the best part.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.539
We're going to make the app
look really good now.

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:09.668
In every developer's workflow it's
important to set aside time for

00:00:09.668 --> 00:00:13.171
some visual polish before
launching the app to your user.

00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:16.975
So often, when you're building
a feature, you're less worried about how

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:20.854
everything looks and you just care that
it actually functions as you expect.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:25.028
So in the visual polish stage,
you have time to take extra care on how

00:00:25.028 --> 00:00:29.659
everything looks making sure things
line up and are consistent for users.

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:32.412
So now it's time to show great care for
your app.

00:00:32.412 --> 00:00:37.299
So our designer gave us these red lines
which have specific details for color,

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:38.938
font size, and spacing.

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:43.162
And these red lines are how the designer
communicates to us precisely how our app

00:00:43.162 --> 00:00:45.270
should look visually.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.230
So for every detail that they provide,

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.870
be sure to implement
that into your app code.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.420
So if the red lines say 16 DP spacing
from the left, then go ahead and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.806
modify your layout to have
that 16 DP of spacing.

00:00:57.806 --> 00:01:01.538
The font color and
font size may also need to change.

00:01:01.538 --> 00:01:04.343
So note that each category of
words should have a different

00:01:04.343 --> 00:01:05.325
background color.

00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:11.191
So orange for numbers, green for family,
purple for colors, and blue for phrases.

00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:15.139
So it's going to take us multiple
quizzes to finish implementing all those

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.793
red lines.

00:01:15.793 --> 00:01:20.282
So in this quiz assume that orange
is fine as the background color for

00:01:20.282 --> 00:01:21.716
all the activities.

00:01:21.716 --> 00:01:22.993
We'll correct it so

00:01:22.993 --> 00:01:27.058
that each activity has a corresponding
correct color later on.

00:01:27.058 --> 00:01:31.739
So in a way, orange is our placeholder
color until we can hook up the correct

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:32.867
logic in our app.

00:01:32.867 --> 00:01:37.290
So to help you out, you may want to
check out a feature on Android devices

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.930
specifically for
developers called show layout bounds.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.472
And you can turn it on under settings,

00:01:43.472 --> 00:01:47.855
developer options, and
then scroll down to show layout bounds.

00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:52.243
When you turn the switch,
you'll see all the bounds on the screen.

00:01:52.243 --> 00:01:56.770
So if we go back to Miwok app,
we can see where all the views are.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.702
So turning on this feature temporarily
may help you figure out how to fix your

00:02:00.702 --> 00:02:02.801
layouts, but note it's not required.

00:02:02.801 --> 00:02:06.617
All right, so
have fun implementing those red lines.

00:02:06.617 --> 00:02:10.002
We've included some hints below
the quiz if you need some help.

00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:12.670
And go ahead and
check this box once you're done.
