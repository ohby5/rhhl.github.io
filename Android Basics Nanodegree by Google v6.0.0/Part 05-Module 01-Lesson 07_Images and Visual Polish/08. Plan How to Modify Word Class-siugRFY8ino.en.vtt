00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.680
All right so
we're making steady progress.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.670
So we've modified the list item
layout to include an image view, and

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.410
we have all the correct
images in the app now.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.730
However, our list view and adapter
don't know about these images just yet.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.100
Now eventually we want to load
the correct images dynamically

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.700
into each list item.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.010
So as the user scrolls up and

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.550
down the list of words, the correct
image is displayed next to the words.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.940
So let's move to step three,
and modify the word class so

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.310
that each word is associated with
an image that we just added.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.740
Let's revisit our word class
in the word.java file.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.160
Remember that this class represents
a single vocabulary word

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.860
that we want the user to learn, and so

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.020
far it contains an English and
Miwok translation for the same word.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.330
So how would you go about modifying
the word class to support these images?

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.810
To help you out,
I like you to answer these questions.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.940
So the first one is, what additional
state would a word object contain?

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.820
Specify the data type and
whether it should be public or private.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.390
And secondly, consider what
additional methods we should have.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.210
Should they be public, or
private, and go ahead and

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.890
answer your questions
in the boxes below.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.860
And as a hint,

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.575
