00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.970
Hey.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:02.950
&gt;&gt; Hey.
&gt;&gt; What's going on?

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.442
&gt;&gt; Just wait for it.

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:05.920
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.880
So, you know how we have a variable
called number of coffees

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.840
ordered in our app.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.840
&gt;&gt; This box.
Yeah.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.942
&gt;&gt; And we had the value two in it.

00:00:11.942 --> 00:00:14.600
&gt;&gt; Correct.
&gt;&gt; If I hit the plus button

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.180
in the app now.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.500
&gt;&gt; Beep
&gt;&gt; Then

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.440
what is the number of
cups of coffee we have?

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.160
&gt;&gt; Well, that would be, increment by
one, so the new value should be three.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
So I'm going to

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.105
throw out this old value and
put in this new one.

00:00:28.105 --> 00:00:29.720
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; If I hit the plus button

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.530
again-
&gt;&gt; Beep!

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.420
&gt;&gt; Then how many cups do I have?

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.630
&gt;&gt; Well now we will
increment that to four.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.888
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; So throw this out, add four in.

00:00:38.888 --> 00:00:40.630
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Now, if I hit the minus button-

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.160
&gt;&gt; Beep beep beep

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.830
&gt;&gt; Then how many cups of

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.380
coffee do I have?

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.476
&gt;&gt; But Catherine I thought you
said there would be no math?

00:00:46.476 --> 00:00:47.848
&gt;&gt; It's one.

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:49.520
Write that down.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.240
Thanks.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.820
Here it is.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.560
One.
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.740
&gt;&gt; Let me give that to you.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.820
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.420
Let's add all of this
into our app now and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.680
we're going to work on your math later
Let's look at the pseudocode for how

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.000
clicking the plus button in the app can
increase the number of coffees ordered.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.950
Pseudocode is a high level
description that explains

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.180
the steps of what the app will do.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.650
We can write it out as if we're
describing it to someone,

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.810
because it's meant for
people to read, not computers.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.270
This helps us put our thoughts into
a linear flow of what needs to happen

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.350
one step after the next.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.630
When writing pseudocode we don't have
to follow any specific structure or

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.090
format, we just need to include useful
details that would help us write

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.980
the code later on.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.450
For our scenario, we want to create
a quantity variable to keep track

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.080
of the number of coffees ordered and
we initialized the value to two coffees.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.550
If the plus button is pressed, we can
update the quantity variable to three.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.090
If we hit the plus button
several more times

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.850
we can increase the quantity to four and
five.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.780
Once we have a conceptual idea in
our head of what the code should do,

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.600
then we can focus on writing
the actual Java code.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.508
At this point then we can worry about
the syntax of Java, the capitalization,

00:01:58.508 --> 00:02:00.100
the symbols, the spacing and

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.160
other specific rules about
how to write Java code.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.030
The real code would look like this
to create a quantity variable and

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.633
set it to two, we would have int
quantity = 2 followed by a ;.

00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:13.440
This is what we covered
in the last video.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.487
To update the quantity variable to 3 we
just need to say quantity = 3 followed

00:02:16.487 --> 00:02:17.140
by a semicolon.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.670
If we update the quantity to 4 and 5,
this is what the code would look like.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.570
For this quiz I want you to practice
typing out these lines of code

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.590
in the text fields provided.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.440
This will give you practice in
creating an integer variable and

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.230
updating it in Java.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.630
Pay close attention to each character
and symbol as you type this out.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.540
When you're done, do you have any
observations about the format of

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.360
the code that you just typed out?

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.950
For example,
do you recognize any patterns?

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.190
Enter any observations
in this text field here.
