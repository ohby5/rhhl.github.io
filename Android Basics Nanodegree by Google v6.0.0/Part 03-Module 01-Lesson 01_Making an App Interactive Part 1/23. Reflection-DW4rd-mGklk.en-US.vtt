Hi Katherine.

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:02.520
&gt;&gt; Hi Kunal.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.920
&gt;&gt; How are you feeling?

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.200
&gt;&gt; I'm feeling a little tired.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.960
How about you?

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:06.730
&gt;&gt; Me too, me too.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.320
I suspect that some of our students
are perhaps feeling the same way.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.240
&gt;&gt; Probably.
&gt;&gt; And that's okay.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.910
It's a really long lesson too.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.
&gt;&gt; And this is a great point for

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.060
them to, at the end of this video,
take a little break and

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.450
walk away from the computer.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and while you're
doing that you could actually

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.170
also show someone the app you've made so
far.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah, talk to your friend about
the new ideas that you have learned

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.730
in the Android world and come back and

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.900
share that conversation with
us on the discussion forum.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
