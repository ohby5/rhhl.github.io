00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.827
Now that we've thoroughly
planned this out, go ahead and

00:00:02.827 --> 00:00:05.140
build out this layout in your app.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.481
You'll need to find and
modify the activity_main.xml file.

00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:12.860
The activity_main.xml
file should already be

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.040
open when you first create your project.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.710
If it's not already open, you can find
this file under the layout folder.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.420
Under res under app in
the project view of your app,

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.680
which lists all the files in your app.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.490
The design pane is open by default,
where you can drag and

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.240
drop widgets from this palette
here over onto the app.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.900
However, I want you to use the text
pane so you can write your XML here.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.970
At any point, when you modify your XML,
you can always select this content and

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.330
reformat it.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.840
Across the top of Android Studio you
should see a bunch of menu items.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.695
Click on Code, and then you'll
find an option to Reformat Code.

00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:50.504
And here's the keyboard
shortcut if you're on Mac.

00:00:50.504 --> 00:00:53.460
You can reformat the code and
selected text is fine.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.330
Just click Run and

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.700
then it automatically reformats your
code to fix the spacing and the tabs.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.090
You can also select Rearrange Code.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.519
It modifies the order of the attributes
here so that it's in the preferred order

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.180
according to the Android
code style guidelines.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.810
And now the code is a lot
easier to read in this format.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.900
If you want a preview of
what this code looks like,

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.424
you can click on
the Preview button here.

00:01:14.515 --> 00:01:16.705
And this shows what it would
look like on a device.

00:01:16.705 --> 00:01:19.195
But this isn't a substitute for
running it on your device, so

00:01:19.195 --> 00:01:21.385
you should always run it on
your device periodically.

00:01:22.535 --> 00:01:26.555
Once you build out this layout,
please also assign a view ID name

00:01:26.555 --> 00:01:29.715
on this second TextView
here that displays a 0.

00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:35.410
Give it a view ID name of
@+id/quantity_text_view.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.040
Use this exact name so
that it will match our code later on.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.770
Remember that we learned how to
assign IDs to views in lesson one.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.770
This example was for relative layout,
where we had a dinner party for

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.010
our best friends and our frenemies.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.590
Also, the reason why we
give this view an ID but

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.620
not the others is because we will want
to later refer to this TextView so

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.100
that we can update it to increase or
decrease the quantity.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.890
For styling the views,
there's a couple small changes.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.490
This TextView here should have a text
size of 16sp and use a black font color.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.118
You can use the black system font color
like we showed you in lesson one or

00:02:11.118 --> 00:02:14.340
you can use the black hex color,
which we've included below.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.060
There's also 16 dp of space in
between each of these views.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.880
I know that this is the first time that
you are going to be adding a button to

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.260
your XML layout.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.080
This is a really great opportunity for
you to practice your Google search

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.400
skills in order to figure out how
to add a button to your layout.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.390
If you really get stuck, you can check
the hint in the instructor notes.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.470
As you build this up,

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.300
periodically run the app on your device
to check that it's working as expected.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.290
When you're done with all of this,
answer this question.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.730
What happens when you
click on this button?
