Hi, Catherine.

00:00:01.515 --> 00:00:02.400
Hi, Keno.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.615
How are you feeling?

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm feeling a little tired. How about you?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.080
Me too. I suspect that some of our students are perhaps feeling the same way.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.670
Probably.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.240
And that's okay, it's a really long lesson too.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.510
Yeah, it is.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.220
And this is a great point for them to at the end of this video,

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.225
take a little break and walk away from the computer.

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:20.580
Yes, and while you're doing that you could

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.160
actually also show someone the app you've made so far.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.360
Yes, talk to your friend about the new ideas that you've learned in the Android world,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.070
and come back and share that conversation with us on the discussion forum.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.200
Yes.
