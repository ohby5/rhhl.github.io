00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.850
After you've modified
the activity main layout file

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.850
to add the on click attribute here, and
you've copied over the new version of

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.460
the main activity code,
then click this green Run button.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.560
When the device chooser pops up,
this option is correct.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.079
And I'm going to click Use same
device for future launches.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.510
And now we have the app
running on our device.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.960
To answer the quiz question,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.510
what happens when you
click on the order button?

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.670
Well it actually updates
the quantity value here to be one.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.090
Exciting.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.740
Now let's understand what's going on
behind the scenes to produce this change

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.330
in the UI.
