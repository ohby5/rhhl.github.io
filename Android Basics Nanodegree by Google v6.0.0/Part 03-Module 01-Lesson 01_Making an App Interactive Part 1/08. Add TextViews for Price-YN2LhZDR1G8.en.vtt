00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
First, we need to modify the activity main lay

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.475
out so that we can add the TextViews for price.

00:00:06.475 --> 00:00:08.750
If the device preview isn't showing ready,

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.945
you can click on this link here that says preview in order to make it appear.

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:14.637
Now when we change the XML,

00:00:14.637 --> 00:00:17.520
we can just see it update automatically here.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.540
In the screenshot we provided to you,

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.535
the price was presented in a similar way to the quantity.

00:00:23.535 --> 00:00:26.910
We have a header as well as a TextView to show the value,

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.310
so we can just copy over these two TextView elements and then paste it beneath it.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.250
Now we just need to tweak the values to fit our scenario.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.290
Instead of quantity, it should say

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.860
price and we should also change the ID to be price TextView.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.910
You can have two views with the same ID.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.190
But anyways, in the quiz,

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.112
we told you to change this to be price TextView so it would match our code.

00:00:52.112 --> 00:00:54.125
There, and that makes the error go away.

00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:55.470
Looking at the preview,

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.020
we have the price header and zero beneath it.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.405
We also want to just change this to be zero dollars,

00:01:01.405 --> 00:01:03.930
and you can use your own currency symbol if you want.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.410
The header is in all caps and the actual price value has

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.990
a tech size of 16sp and a black text color.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.490
That looks good so far,

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.260
except I do notice that there needs to be

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.825
a little more vertical space between the price header and the quantity value.

00:01:18.825 --> 00:01:23.320
I'm just going to change all the views so that they have a margin top value of 16dp.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.080
And then instead of margin bottom here,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.455
I'm just going to do margin top 16,

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:32.000
and that actually fixes it.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.865
Cool! Now all the views are evenly spaced apart.

00:01:34.865 --> 00:01:37.563
Once you think the XML is in a good state,

00:01:37.563 --> 00:01:39.660
then you can just run on your device.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.265
Cool! And that looks good.

00:01:42.265 --> 00:01:44.749
Let's work on the main activity file now.

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:47.020
If this Android DDMS window pops up,

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.280
you can just collapse it using this arrow.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.910
In the main activity, we asked you to copy and

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.195
paste the display price method that we gave you.

00:01:55.195 --> 00:01:57.010
Hopefully, you also modified

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.050
your Android studio preferences to

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.125
automatically import things if there were an ambiguous.

00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:06.295
That would help resolve the problem of it not knowing what number format referred to.

00:02:06.295 --> 00:02:08.005
But now with the import statement,

00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:10.765
the app knows that number format is something that's provided

00:02:10.765 --> 00:02:13.895
automatically by Java to help format numbers.

00:02:13.895 --> 00:02:17.530
Then for the last step, we modify the Submit order method so that when

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.000
the button is clicked we display the quantity and also display the price.
