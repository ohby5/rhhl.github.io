00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.490
Next, we'll fix the behavior
of the Order button.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.390
Once I change the quantity to something
like six, if I hit the Order button,

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.510
the price should update to $30.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.500
However, when I click the Order button,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.770
it always changes the quantity
back to five and the price to $25.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.400
So this behavior is incorrect.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.540
To test your understanding of
everything we've learned so

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.690
far, I want you to go ahead and
fix this bug on your own.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.750
I'm confident that you can do it.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.270
This is a very common occurrence
during app development.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.733
You build out more functionality of
your app, like this quantity picker, but

00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:33.160
then it can have ripple effects
on the rest of your app.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.576
And it may break something,
like this Order button.

00:00:35.576 --> 00:00:37.500
So you have to just go back and
fix that later.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.690
Once you've completed this task,
this is what the app should look like.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.230
If I increase the quantity
to something like six, and

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.690
I hit the Order button, then the price
changes to $30, which is correct.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.250
To help you tackle this problem,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.620
first identify all the things that are
wrong with the current state of the app.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.940
You can look at it on your device,
and so

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.070
it will be easier than
looking at this screenshot.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.120
This screenshot shows setting
the quantity to six and

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.620
then hitting the Order button and
seeing the result on the screen.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.010
I want you to describe in words
the gap between what we have now and

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.560
what we want.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.800
Be as detailed as possible by
writing your answer in this box.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.110
The more specific you can get about all
the things that are wrong with the app,

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.300
the easier it will be to fix the problem
because you'll have almost a task list

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.728
on how to get to the ideal solution.

00:01:23.728 --> 00:01:26.740
Then after you've planned how you
will attack the problem, go ahead and

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.910
implement those changes in your app.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.520
Once the Order button works as expected,
pat yourself on the back, and

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.930
then check this box to continue.
