00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.740
Hello.
You all know Catherine.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.270
We've been making the course together.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.700
Today, we have a really
special guest for you.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.290
Alice works for Google and
has been working there for-

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.200
&gt;&gt; 11 plus years.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.100
&gt;&gt; 11 plus years.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.220
So, we're going to talk about Alice's
journey in terms of her first interview,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.770
how she solves bugs, and
some advice Alice would

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.300
give herself, from way back when, when
she was wanting to learn programming.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.500
Shall we begin.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.050
&gt;&gt; So, Alice, can you tell us
about your role at Google now?

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.220
&gt;&gt; Sure.
So, right now, I'm a TL for

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.320
a new project.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.410
TL is for tech lead.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.060
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.670
&gt;&gt; For a new project on Android.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.090
It's in the very early stages so

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.940
I can't really talk about
exactly what the project is.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.611
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:48.341
&gt;&gt; But I can tell you a little bit about

00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:51.130
what I've been doing the last few years.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.470
&gt;&gt; So,
let's start at the very beginning.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.100
&gt;&gt; The very beginning.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.920
&gt;&gt; So, you come in and
what happens the first few years.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.930
&gt;&gt; So, the first six years at Google,
I was in AdWords, AdWords front end.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.722
So, AdWords is basically
how Google makes money.

00:01:02.722 --> 00:01:04.072
So, when you do a Google search,

00:01:04.072 --> 00:01:06.009
all those ads that pop up
on the right hand side.

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.903
So, I worked on, and AdWords back then,

00:01:08.903 --> 00:01:12.791
it was like the first group
at Google who was doing Java,

00:01:12.791 --> 00:01:17.286
all the other engineers were
C++ engineers, like on search.

00:01:17.286 --> 00:01:18.029
&gt;&gt; Oh, I didn't know that.

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:20.908
&gt;&gt; Yes, so, we were the first Java team.

00:01:20.908 --> 00:01:25.034
And we set a lot of standards
about how Java was going to,

00:01:25.034 --> 00:01:30.371
setting the Java coding style, for
example, and what tools to use.

00:01:30.371 --> 00:01:31.994
So yeah, it was very fun.

00:01:31.994 --> 00:01:34.710
I think it was, back then, it was small.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.150
I remember carrying the pager for
AdWords.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.450
On weekends, all the engineers
take turns carrying the pagers.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.022
So, if a server goes down,
you have to be prepared to log in,

00:01:45.022 --> 00:01:46.297
reboot the machine.

00:01:46.297 --> 00:01:49.675
It was before we had SREs.

00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:53.401
SREs means site reliability engineers,
I believe.

00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:54.040
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.480
&gt;&gt; So, yeah, it was very different from-
&gt;&gt; I had never imagined that

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.400
when a server goes down
there are literally pagers

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.960
going off-
&gt;&gt; Oh yes.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.770
&gt;&gt; In the background where people
are sort of hustling to try and

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.230
get the machine up again.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.150
&gt;&gt; Yes, they can go off like
any time of the day, 4:00 AM.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.720
&gt;&gt; Mm.
&gt;&gt; So,

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.668
it's kind of like
a doctor being on call.

00:02:11.668 --> 00:02:12.339
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:15.790
I'd imagine that as
thrilling as it was for

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.350
you to get the job,
some parts of the job may be stressful.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.510
Like this idea of this pager
is going to go off and

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.762
interrupt the fun that
you were perhaps having.

00:02:25.762 --> 00:02:29.962
Do you recall any instances where you
felt like this is really stressful and

00:02:29.962 --> 00:02:31.571
hard work that we are doing?

00:02:31.571 --> 00:02:34.747
&gt;&gt; So,
I think when I was on Android Gmail,

00:02:34.747 --> 00:02:39.530
I think that was actually pretty
stressful time of being TL.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.770
&gt;&gt; Okay, so we moved on from AdWords, so
you're now doing Gmail, but for Android.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:45.300
&gt;&gt; Android, yes.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.960
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So, actually, Catherine and

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.840
I worked together on Android.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.170
&gt;&gt; Oh, nice!
&gt;&gt; That's how we met,

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.470
that's [INAUDIBLE] together.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.910
But, yes, so,
Android is very different from AdWords.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.460
I think mainly because it's
a consumer product, so

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.640
it's just a different set of users,
it's a lot more users.

00:03:05.042 --> 00:03:11.318
And on Gmail particularly, because it's
one of the most used apps on Android,

00:03:11.318 --> 00:03:15.637
just the pure number of bugs
that we get is just insane.

00:03:15.637 --> 00:03:19.304
At Google we have this
thing called dog fooding.

00:03:19.304 --> 00:03:24.461
That means if your app is ready
to release, your new version,

00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:29.036
then you test it internally,
among all the Googlers.

00:03:29.036 --> 00:03:32.299
So you kind of dog food your own
products, eat your own dog food.

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:38.107
And for Gmail, every time we dog
food a new version people will be so

00:03:38.107 --> 00:03:41.410
passionate and found so many bugs.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.372
We move one button from top right corner
to the bottom right corner, and there

00:03:47.372 --> 00:03:53.250
will be like 20 people complaining about
it changes their work flow, for example.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.125
So I think making those
decisions was really tough,

00:03:58.125 --> 00:04:01.020
because it's hard to find
a solution that pleases everyone.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.070
&gt;&gt; So, it may be surprising for
some of our students to understand, but

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.950
this idea of feeling frustrated
because a bug has been encountered,

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.900
is not something just the novice
programmers are feeling.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.730
Even expert programmers like you
Alice can get bogged down by them.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.620
Do you have a strategy or tool you
follow when you say come across a bug?

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.230
&gt;&gt; So, it depends on the type of bug.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.186
So, bugs can be very different,
the most I

00:04:27.186 --> 00:04:32.720
guess important or high priority
bugs are crashes, for example.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.205
Your app is just not functional.

00:04:34.205 --> 00:04:36.945
And those are probably ones
that will get looked at first.

00:04:36.945 --> 00:04:39.735
They'll flag that as P0s or P1s, and

00:04:39.735 --> 00:04:42.980
also it depends on how
reproducible it is.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:43.990
&gt;&gt; P, in that stands for
priority, I imagine.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.534
&gt;&gt; Priority, exactly, yes.

00:04:45.534 --> 00:04:48.996
P0, P1, P2,
&gt;&gt; An engineer who received the bug,

00:04:48.996 --> 00:04:50.036
think of a bug, and

00:04:50.036 --> 00:04:53.938
what would be your strategy to going
about fixing something like that.

00:04:53.938 --> 00:04:58.710
&gt;&gt; Bug fixing is one of the most,
it's like a very easy way, or

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.640
quick way to feel like.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.310
You fix this bug and it's very rewarding
because I can mark it as fixed and

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.160
it's like I accomplished something.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.110
I think usually, first off,
is trying to reproduce it.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.500
So, if it's reproducible,
then it's much easier to fix.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.221
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:14.743
&gt;&gt; The hardest bugs
are the non-producible ones,

00:05:14.743 --> 00:05:17.880
something that on Catherine's Android
device you saw, but

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.299
then on my phone I was
never able to reproduce.

00:05:20.299 --> 00:05:21.658
So, that's much harder.

00:05:21.658 --> 00:05:26.949
So, if it's reproducible,
then I can easily just look at the logs,

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:29.518
ADB logcats on Android devices.

00:05:29.518 --> 00:05:32.398
And then see what happens.

00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:36.510
If it's a crash then there would
be a very obvious stack trace.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.943
&gt;&gt; So, you're like an investigator,
you're looking at clues for

00:05:38.943 --> 00:05:40.237
why this thing might be breaking?

00:05:40.237 --> 00:05:41.238
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
Yes.

00:05:41.238 --> 00:05:44.834
And Android bug reports
are actually notorious for

00:05:44.834 --> 00:05:47.599
being really cryptic and hard to read.

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:48.516
Yes.

00:05:48.516 --> 00:05:50.834
&gt;&gt; It's not just us.

00:05:50.834 --> 00:05:52.680
[LAUGH] Oh no, yes.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.048
&gt;&gt; I find them to be very verbose and
cryptic also.

00:05:55.048 --> 00:05:59.510
&gt;&gt; Yes, I think it's one of
the big challenges actually.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.960
So, that's where experience comes in.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.126
So, if you're an experienced
Android programmer,

00:06:04.126 --> 00:06:06.063
you know exactly which
keywords to search for.

00:06:06.063 --> 00:06:08.385
It's impossible to just
read line by line by line.

00:06:08.385 --> 00:06:13.100
I usually just like prep for or
search for certain keywords.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.646
&gt;&gt; I see.
So,

00:06:13.646 --> 00:06:16.816
you're scanning through the entire
log and you're looking for

00:06:16.816 --> 00:06:18.360
keywords that you can Google.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.258
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Okay,

00:06:19.258 --> 00:06:21.901
why are you Googling these things?

00:06:21.901 --> 00:06:25.210
&gt;&gt; Well, I do a search locally,
just like a find.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.820
But Google comes in handy because
often if there is an error and

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.350
it's something I'm not familiar with,
it could be like Android Framework doing

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.275
some illegal state exception or
something that I've never seen before.

00:06:37.275 --> 00:06:38.563
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; So, the first thing I would do is

00:06:38.563 --> 00:06:39.283
actually Google it.

00:06:39.283 --> 00:06:39.841
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:06:39.841 --> 00:06:43.589
&gt;&gt; And yeah, and
usually on let's say, stack overflow,

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:48.240
there's almost always somebody
else who has encountered the same.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.749
&gt;&gt; Is to follow similar processes.

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:51.218
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Where they find a bug,

00:06:51.218 --> 00:06:54.172
they try to identify a key word
that they can search on Google?

00:06:54.172 --> 00:06:54.787
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:06:54.787 --> 00:06:57.640
&gt;&gt; And try and interpret those results,
and try and fix the bug.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.832
Now, what's really satisfying,
at least for me as a teacher,

00:07:00.832 --> 00:07:04.560
here to learn is that the process that
we're teaching our students is being

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.242
followed by an expert 11
years into their program.

00:07:07.242 --> 00:07:08.193
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yes.

00:07:08.193 --> 00:07:10.990
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And you mentioned a statement which

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.196
was really emphatic to me, which is,
if I don't know something.

00:07:15.196 --> 00:07:16.135
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:07:16.135 --> 00:07:19.544
&gt;&gt; And that's really important to
understand, that even after 11 years of

00:07:19.544 --> 00:07:22.570
expertise, there are so
many things that one might not know.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.755
&gt;&gt; Yes,
it's impossible to know everything.

00:07:24.755 --> 00:07:30.410
And, yeah, I realize, there's something
new to learn every day actually,

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.580
and at my job I feel like I do indeed
learn something new every day.
