In the Soonami app,

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.430
when we form the HTTP request
to the USGS server, we specify

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.280
GET as the HTTP method because we want
to retrieve data from the server.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.010
In other words, we just want to read
earthquake information from the USGS.
