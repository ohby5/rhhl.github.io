Congratulations.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.245
You've completed lesson two.

00:00:03.245 --> 00:00:05.043
[SOUND] That was a lot of concepts.

00:00:05.043 --> 00:00:08.507
&gt;&gt; Piece by piece, you're learning
about all the components involved in

00:00:08.507 --> 00:00:12.230
retrieving data from the Internet and
displaying it in an app.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
We covered how to create and

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.240
configure an HTTP request,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.130
as well as how to send a request
using the HTTP URL connection class.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.790
&gt;&gt; Then, we learned how to receive and
parse the response.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.680
Remember that the response
comes as a stream of data and

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.630
we use a buffered reader
to convert the input stream

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.710
into a string while learning
about the string builder class.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.530
&gt;&gt; Totally.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.620
There are a lot of tough
concepts in this lesson, so

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.990
be proud of yourself for
persisting through it.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.720
&gt;&gt; Hey Chris, what's the best
way to really learn something?

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.330
&gt;&gt; What's that?

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.430
&gt;&gt; Is to teach somebody else.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah, great idea.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.730
So why don't you find a friend or
a family member and

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.770
explain what you learn in this lesson.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.360
You can use a networking diagram
to help you teach concepts.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.190
&gt;&gt; Then, let us know how
the conversation went by sharing your

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.220
experience in the discussion forum.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.650
Good luck, you're going to do great.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.210
&gt;&gt; Awesome work
finishing up this lesson.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.000
Now, it's always good

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.349
to reflect a little bit about
the things that you've learned.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.900
So I want you to go ahead and explain
what you've learned about networking

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.530
this lesson to a friend or
a family member.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.070
And feel free to use the diagrams
linked below if they're helpful.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.680
More than anything,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.840
it'd be great if you could share your
experience in the discussion forum.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.860
So feel free to do that,
and check this box here.
