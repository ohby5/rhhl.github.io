When we're all done forming the HTTP
request, we tell the Android system to

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.480
package and send out the request
over the Internet to the server,

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.800
which is step two of the process.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.900
In the Soonami app,

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.780
what line of code actually
establishes the HTTP connection?

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.610
Copy and
paste the line of code right here.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.840
Once we have the connection, you'll see
that we can read information from it or

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.940
write new information to send to
the server over that same connection.
