00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.110
Http is the core technology that
handles how data is exchanged over

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.010
the World Wide Web, so
let's discuss that for a bit.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.840
Http stands for hypertext transfer
protocol and hails from the earlier days

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.330
of the web when computers transmitted
just basic webpage information.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.310
So what is a protocol?

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.940
Well, a protocol is simply a predefined
set of rules that allows computers to

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.470
communicate and coordinate with one
another in order to complete a task.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.164
In this case,
that goal is to exchange messages and

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:34.200
or data across the internet.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.850
Well, how does this communication work?

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.330
Client computers, talking HTTP,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.450
transmit messages containing
specific HTTP methods, or verbs,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.445
that convey their intention or request
to a receiving computer or server.

00:00:50.445 --> 00:00:54.455
The server receives and
interprets the message, reacts, and

00:00:54.455 --> 00:00:58.025
then sends a response back through
the internet to the client.

00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:01.605
This is a request and
response exchange paradigm.

00:01:01.605 --> 00:01:05.245
Here are some examples of the most
commonly used HTP methods or

00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:06.345
verbs used today.

00:01:07.475 --> 00:01:08.930
Here's a GET.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.050
Get means I'd like to get or
retrieve some data from you.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.100
Server will respond with okay,
here's your information.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.580
A post means I'd like to
create some new information.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.360
A put means I'd like to update
some existing information.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.040
Now, the server doesn't always
have to respond with a thumbs up.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.195
Maybe something went wrong.

00:01:30.195 --> 00:01:32.530
Maybe it doesn't know what
you're talking about.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.870
And it could yield some sort
of unsatisfactory response.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.983
Delete, just simply means that I'd like
to delete some existing information on

00:01:40.983 --> 00:01:42.230
the server.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.740
This was a quick overview of
the most commonly used HTP verbs but

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.730
you can find the complete
set linked below.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.934
Typical web browsing tasks
like loading Facebook or

00:01:51.934 --> 00:01:55.630
Google.com can consist of
hundreds of http requests.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.290
What I'm want to do now is use
Chrome developer tools to show you

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.240
exactly what's getting loaded into
Google.com when we reload the page.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.380
Developer tools has a number of useful
pieces of information and in this

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.310
case we going to click on the network
tab and I'm going to reload Google.com.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.240
And we can see all
the little things that come

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.850
loading into the page right here.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.720
See, some of them are documents,
some are images, some are scripts.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.220
In the same way, EPI exchanges
contain multiple requests, but

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.140
are often an order of magnitude
smaller than loading a web page

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.240
mainly because there's so
much less data and media to load.
