00:00:00.159 --> 00:00:04.488
Within the app code, if you look
at the make HTTP request method,

00:00:04.488 --> 00:00:08.358
you'll see the line that
says urlConnection.connect.

00:00:08.358 --> 00:00:12.501
This is where we actually establish
the HTTP connection with the server.

00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:16.850
Everything before this line of code
was about setting up the HTTP request.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.910
Everything after this line of code
is about receiving the response and

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.990
making sense of it for our app.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.250
If you check the documentation,
it says that the connect method opens

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.200
a connection to the given resource which
was the URL that we specified earlier.
