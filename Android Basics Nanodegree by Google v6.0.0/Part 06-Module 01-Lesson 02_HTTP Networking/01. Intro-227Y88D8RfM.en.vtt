Hey Chris.

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:03.170
How you feeling about
the earthquake app so far?

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.710
&gt;&gt; You know, pretty good.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.010
We covered a lot last lesson, and
the app's looking pretty slick.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.530
&gt;&gt; It does look very slick.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.590
However we only pretended that we got
a list of the earthquakes from the USGS.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.430
&gt;&gt; True.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.310
&gt;&gt; We just copy and pasted the data
that we got from the web browser and

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.770
hard coded it as a string into our app.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.470
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.980
&gt;&gt; In this lesson, lesson two,

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.990
we're going to learn about networking,
which is an exchange of information that

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.080
happens between computers
over the Internet.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is a powerful concept
because you'll be able to request data

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.310
from anywhere on the Internet and
display it on your phone.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.550
&gt;&gt; Networking is
a fairly advanced topic.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.728
So if it sounds a little scary,
don't worry.

00:00:39.728 --> 00:00:44.430
There are semester-long college
courses that cover only the subject.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.390
The main goal here is that you'll
have more questions about how these

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.690
things work.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.138
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we don't want you to get
overwhelmed with all the details.

00:00:51.138 --> 00:00:53.990
So we're going to provide you with just
enough information at just the right

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.480
time so you'll understand
the high level process and

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.210
how to write the Android
code to make it happen.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.220
&gt;&gt; Dude, we should tell
them about the Soonami app.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we totally should.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.379
Well, it helps to work with
a working version of networking code

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.870
before you write it yourself.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:07.550
So in this lesson,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.270
we're going to be using a sample
app called the Soonami app.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.030
The Soonami app uses the same
USGS API as the Quake Report app, but

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.290
with a slightly different use case,
showing whether or

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.000
not a particular Soonami alert was
issued for a particular earthquake.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.330
In this lesson, you'll practice reading
and understanding how the Soonami app

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.530
makes an HTTP request to the USGS
service and receives a response back.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so just to be clear, the
Soonami app is meant to prepare you so

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.020
you can write the networking code
on your own in the QuakeReport app

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.190
in lesson three.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.020
This is going to be good,
let's get started.
