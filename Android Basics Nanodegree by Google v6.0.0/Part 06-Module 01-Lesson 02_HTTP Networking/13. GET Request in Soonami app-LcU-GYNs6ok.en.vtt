00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.530
Going back to our Soonami app code,

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.696
we see that the HTTP request
method is set to GET.

00:00:05.696 --> 00:00:07.469
So why is this the case?

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:10.642
Use your knowledge about what you
just learned about the HTTP request

00:00:10.642 --> 00:00:13.260
method types to answer
the question here.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.600
In the Soonami app HTTP request,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.760
why are we using a GET method
instead of a POST method?
