00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.719
Cool, so it looks like we found
a service with the data that we need.

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.050
But to get that data it looks like we
need to download a complicated form,

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.650
then read our results off a map,
or download a spreadsheet.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.720
I'm not sure how we're
going to use this service.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.200
&gt;&gt; Well, why can't we just embed
the spreadsheet into our app?

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.890
&gt;&gt; Well, I think we could, but
it would be an updating nightmare.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.160
Especially for users.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.050
I mean every single time there's
new data, we'd have to re-download

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.930
the spreadsheet, recompile the app,
then republish it to Google Play.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.360
Not to mention, every single time there
was new data, users would also have to

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.610
update their apps every single time
we updated, which was like daily.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah, talk about a poor experience.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.120
&gt;&gt; That is a problem.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.826
Well, perhaps we'll just have our
app pick up some drive-through data.

00:00:39.826 --> 00:00:41.680
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What do you mean?

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.570
&gt;&gt; Get this.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.740
You can think of a data source
like a fast food restaurant.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.850
You know, the kind with indoor
seating and a drive-through.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.670
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; You see,

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.380
when you're not sure what
you want at a restaurant,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.490
you probably want to go inside,
look at the menu, talk to the staff, and

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.020
they'll take care of
bringing the food to you.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.990
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.020
&gt;&gt; But when you know exactly what food
you want, you're probably okay going

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.480
through the drive-thru making a precise
order and then getting your food

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.290
returned to you all nicely
packaged up at the pick-up window.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.670
&gt;&gt; Are you sure we're still
talking about earthquakes?

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.910
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.858
&gt;&gt; For example, when you navigate to
the USGS website and fill out the form

00:01:16.858 --> 00:01:19.950
querying for what earthquakes you want,
that's like going in and

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.770
sitting down at the restaurant You're
getting the human friendly experience.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.020
&gt;&gt; Okay, I got you.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.360
&gt;&gt; But
if you're another computer program, or

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.300
an app that wants to use data from USGS,
then there's the drive-through window.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.920
You see, you can customize a request for
data and it gets returned to you in

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.010
a simple format that a program
can easily understand.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.820
&gt;&gt; Hm, let me think about that.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.290
So you mean there's dine-in data for
humans, and drive-through data for apps?

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.350
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.074
And the drive-through window is kind of
like an application programming

00:01:51.074 --> 00:01:51.780
interface.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.780
&gt;&gt; Right, an API.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.280
So it's basically a way for

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.660
another application to talk
to a service via code.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.160
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.920
&gt;&gt; So, burgers?

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.890
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, let me call.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:01.570
&gt;&gt; Let's do it.
