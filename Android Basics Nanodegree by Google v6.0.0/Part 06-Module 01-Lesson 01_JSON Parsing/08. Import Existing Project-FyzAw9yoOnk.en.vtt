00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.835
Okay. So, here we are in Android Studio.

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:05.775
And we have the project pane open.

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:09.630
Let's become familiar with the code base for the Quake-Report app. All right.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.980
So, the first thing we're going to do is go to

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.310
the app directory and look in the Java folder.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.070
This is where all the logic for the app is.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.620
Then when I moved down here to the resources folder, expand it.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.545
This is the folder that contains everything related to the appearance of the app.

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:28.875
These files control how the app appears on different devices.

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:31.409
Resources can include XML files,

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:33.825
images and other media files.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:36.410
We can start by expanding out the layout folder.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.005
Here we have the earthquake_activity.xml file.

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:43.095
This file defines the layout for the main screen in our app,

00:00:43.095 --> 00:00:44.490
which is just a list view.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.485
Then we have the mipmap folder,

00:00:46.485 --> 00:00:48.930
which is a special folder just for the app icon.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.980
Other images in your app should go in the drawable folders.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.695
Then we have the values folder,

00:00:55.695 --> 00:00:59.560
this contains the colors.xml file which defines the colors for our app.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.955
And we also have some additional resource files for the styles and themes,

00:01:03.955 --> 00:01:06.050
as well as tech strings.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.880
All right, so let's go back to the Java folder.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.395
We have one Java file called the EarthquakeActivity.

00:01:12.395 --> 00:01:16.740
And it turns out that the EarthquakeActivity is the main screen for our app.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.890
When the activity is created,

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.000
we set the content view to the earthquake_activity.xml layout.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.130
Then we create a fake list of earthquakes,

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.895
because this is placeholder data until we get real data from the server.

00:01:28.895 --> 00:01:32.435
We represent the list of earthquakes as an array list of strings,

00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:35.505
which then contains the names of different cities.

00:01:35.505 --> 00:01:39.810
Then we create an array adapter which knows how to create list item views,

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.900
one for each earthquake in the array list.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.170
And then the list items will be added into

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.810
the list view that we defined in our earthquake_activity.xml layout.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.200
Last but not least, we have the AndroidManifest file.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.220
This file contains important information about

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.530
our app that the Android system needs to know.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.125
For example, the package name,

00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:04.530
the app name and the activities. All right.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.730
Now going back to our quiz,

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.580
here are the answers to the questions.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.490
Our main activity is defined in the EarthquakeActivity.java file.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:19.605
And the layout for the activity is defined in the earthquake_activity.xml file.

00:02:19.605 --> 00:02:22.759
And lastly, within our earthquake activity class,

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.715
we have an array list variable called earthquakes,

00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:29.330
which holds the list of earthquake locations as strings.
