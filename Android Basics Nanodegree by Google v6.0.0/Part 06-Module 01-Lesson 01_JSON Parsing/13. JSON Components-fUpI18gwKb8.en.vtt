00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.440
All right.

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.530
Let's start by looking for

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.750
the name key in the example JSON
response from the Twitter API request.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.660
By searching the response for
the name key,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.290
we actually see that it appears
multiple times for different uses.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.230
Sometimes the value is Tony Fadell.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.390
Sometimes the value is Sebastian Thrun,
and sometimes it's Udacity.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.960
In all three cases,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.360
the value appears to be a string that
represents the name of a Twitter user.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.540
So in the quiz, the name key maps
to the string JSON primitive.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.320
Next, we'll look for the user key.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.960
The user key maps to a value that
is enclosed in curly braces.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.900
That means it maps to a JSON object with
a lot more attributes about that Twitter

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.270
user with the name shernazdaver,
screen_name, and other information.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.010
If you look at the other
cases where user appears,

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.200
you'll find other Twitter users.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.900
So that means the user key
maps to a JSON object.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.980
Next, we'll look for the hashtags key.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.850
The hashtags key maps to a JSON array

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.780
because it points to a value
with square brackets.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.400
There's one hashtag in this
tweet which is I\/O 16.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.650
This is the hashtag for
the 2016 Google IO conference.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.070
If there are more hashtags in this
tweet, they would show up in this array.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.430
So the hashtag key maps to a JSON array.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.588
Next, we'll look for
the followers_count key.

00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:31.580
The key followers_count maps to
the number of followers this

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.359
Twitter user has,
which is 460291 in this case.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.570
So the followers count key
maps to a JSON Primitive.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.170
Which is an integer in this case.
