00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.700
Now, the switch statement here is
testing whether the spice level

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.790
integer variable is equal to
a list of possible values.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.862
If the spice level is 0, let's go
ahead and step through the code,

00:00:11.862 --> 00:00:16.340
which means it doesn't equal 1,
it doesn't equal 2 or 3 or 4.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.073
So we can skip these cases and

00:00:18.073 --> 00:00:21.187
that means it's going to
fall into the default case.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:24.660
So we set the flavor to be not spicy.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.200
Now what happens when
the spice level is 2?

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.360
That means it doesn't evaluate
in the first case for 1, so

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.035
we skip that case but it does equal 2.

00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:38.685
So it falls into the second case which
sets the flavor string to be medium,

00:00:38.685 --> 00:00:39.860
all right.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.331
Now this case is interesting.

00:00:41.331 --> 00:00:44.180
What happens when the spice level is 3?

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.738
Now, looking into our code, we fall into
case 3 and we set the flavor to be hot.

00:00:50.738 --> 00:00:51.962
But there's no break statement.

00:00:51.962 --> 00:00:54.553
So we're actually going to
fall into the 4th case,

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:57.710
which sets the flavor
string to very hot.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.340
Now that just means we just overrode
the flavor variable with a new value.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.550
Then we hit a break statement,
which will execute our switch statement.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.100
So the latest value of the flavor string
when we exit the switch statement

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.230
is actually very hot.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.610
The last few cases
are fairly straightforward.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.580
For a spiceLevel of 1,
the flavor is going to be mild.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.630
For a spiceLevel of 4,
the flavor is also going to be very hot.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.200
And then lastly, for a spiceLevel of 10,
there is no explicit case.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.290
So we fall into the default case again,
and that flavor is not spicy.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.210
Great work.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.350
Hope you got some good practice in,

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.290
and feel more comfortable
with switch statements.
