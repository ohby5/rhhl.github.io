00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.220
Let's talk about how we human
characterize and describe earthquakes.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.710
Earthquakes occur everyday,
all over the world.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.934
The result of the energy being
released through seismic activity,

00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:18.453
which can be caused by tectonic plate
movement, volcanic activity, or

00:00:18.453 --> 00:00:22.546
even advanced like meteor impact or
nuclear weapon that nation.

00:00:22.546 --> 00:00:26.746
Earthquakes can be described
in terms of their magnitude,

00:00:26.746 --> 00:00:30.370
epicenter, depth, date, and so on.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.210
We might want to display some
of these properties in our app.

00:00:34.227 --> 00:00:36.606
All right, taking a quick glance
around the USGS homepage.

00:00:36.606 --> 00:00:41.005
It looks like a lot of
the information that we want is here.

00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:42.745
Let's check out an earthquake
to see what we got.

00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:44.545
This looks good.

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:47.335
We've got maps, we've got time.

00:00:47.335 --> 00:00:52.000
You've got near by places,
descriptions of location.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.018
Magnitude up here, looking good.

00:00:55.018 --> 00:00:58.012
All right, let's back up and see if
we can find any developer oriented

00:00:58.012 --> 00:00:59.550
information that we can work with.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.030
All right, if I scroll down here's
a link for real time feeds and

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.379
notifications.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.360
Let's see what we get in here.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.250
Looks like there's a lot of useful
ways to consume the USGS earthquake

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.879
data here.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.960
ATOM syndication is used for
feed readers,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.134
this earthquake notification
service can send you an email or

00:01:20.134 --> 00:01:23.280
cellphone alert when
earthquake's happen.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.986
Use Google Earth KML to visualize
earthquakes around the globe right

00:01:27.986 --> 00:01:29.533
within Google Earth.

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:34.210
We got access to Tweeter,
Spreadsheet Format and QuakeML.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.640
Let's take a look at
the Spreadsheet Format for a minute.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.170
So looks like this page has a good
description of the Spreadsheet Format

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.420
including the types of field
that we would build access.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.339
And in fact, there's a little screenshot
here, that shows what it would look

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:55.781
like if you imported this into Excel or
Google Sheets.

00:01:55.781 --> 00:01:58.993
And you can see right at the top,
we got headings for

00:01:58.993 --> 00:02:03.770
Time, Latitude,Longitude,
Debt, and Mag for magnitude.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.682
And we can see what the data format
looks like this was like a timestamp,

00:02:07.682 --> 00:02:12.050
latitude and longitude or
numbers and depth is a number,

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.880
magnitude is a number so good.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.830
We have some information
to work with here.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.395
It looks like the USGS earthquake
data is structured in a way that we

00:02:21.395 --> 00:02:23.060
might find useful for our app.
