00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.210
All right, so let's find the path to
get to the properties in the first

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.820
earthquake in the list.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.140
Now, we always start the root,
so we look for

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.990
the JSON array with the key features,
which is right here.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.100
Again, we know this is an array based on
the left and right square brackets, and

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.260
we can expand out from there.

00:00:17.298 --> 00:00:21.170
Then we want to find the object that
it's mapped to by the key properties.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.130
So if you collapse this,

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.130
we also see that this is an object,
and expand further to go deeper.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.130
Now, here's the meaning
of the extraction.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.961
This object contains all
the attributes we care about.

00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:38.349
We've got the magnitude as a decimal,
we've got the place as a string,

00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:43.078
and we've got the time as
a very large integer value.

00:00:43.078 --> 00:00:45.480
And then,
we have the URL also as a string value.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.870
So by following the logic
we just mentioned,

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.870
here are the traversal paths for
the magnitude, the location, the time,

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.580
and the website URL of
the first earthquake.
