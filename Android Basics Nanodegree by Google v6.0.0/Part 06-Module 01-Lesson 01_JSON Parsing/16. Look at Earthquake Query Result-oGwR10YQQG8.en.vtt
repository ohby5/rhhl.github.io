00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.159
In case you're curious, this URL is
actually representing the earthquakes

00:00:04.159 --> 00:00:07.760
from the world from January
1st to January 30th in 2016.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.230
That at least have a minimum magnitude
of six on the Richter scale.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.890
Now I also limited the response
to ten earthquakes so

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.850
you wouldn't have to sketch as much for
a long time.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.210
Then I copied the raw JSON response and
pasted it into a JSON formatter and

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.900
went ahead and processed it.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.770
Okay, this looks a lot better.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.060
So first we need to get
to the features key,

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.740
then get the first element of the array.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.700
Then get the properties key
which returns the JSON object.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.360
And then get to the mag, place, and

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.690
time keys for
the data that we need in our app.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.230
Notice that the magnitude is
7.2 as we mentioned earlier.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.820
The location is stored
in a key cold place, and

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.948
corresponding value is 88 kilometers
north of Yelizovo, Russia.

00:00:53.948 --> 00:00:57.165
For now, let's just write
the city location in our sketch.

00:00:57.165 --> 00:00:58.576
There is no date key, but

00:00:58.576 --> 00:01:02.622
we have time which maps to a really
long number as we mentioned earlier.

00:01:02.622 --> 00:01:05.315
This is the time in milliseconds
since January 1st 1970.

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:08.915
We could convert this
into a readable date, but

00:01:08.915 --> 00:01:11.025
let's just leave it in milliseconds for
now.

00:01:11.025 --> 00:01:13.435
Okay great,
that completes the first item,

00:01:13.435 --> 00:01:15.351
then we can move onto the second
earthquake in the list.

00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:19.533
In the JSON response,
let's scroll down to our second feature.

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:24.459
This one has a magnitude of 6.1 and
it's located in Papua, New Guinea, and

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:27.220
it happened at a time of 145377 etc.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.330
We can update our sketch
with this information.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.640
We can repeat these steps for

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.930
the remaining ten earthquakes
in the JSON response.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.700
And when you finish, your sketch
will look something like this.
