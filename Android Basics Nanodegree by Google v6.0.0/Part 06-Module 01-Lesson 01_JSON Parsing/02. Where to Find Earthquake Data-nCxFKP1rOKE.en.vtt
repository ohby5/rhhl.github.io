00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.934
Alright so why don't we search for
something like earthquake deed api.

00:00:04.934 --> 00:00:07.520
Look at this first result,
looks pretty good, actually.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.550
It's from the USGS,
which is the geological survey.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah the USGS earthquake
site is awesome.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.560
Since we feel a lot of
quakes here in California,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.200
if I ever experience one,
I'll usually run over here and try and

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.610
look up the magnitude and epicenter,
and see if other people are feeling it.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.520
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.040
Yeah, it looks super useful.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.550
Although I'm seeing this
site here called seismi,

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.260
which seems to be about
visualizing earthquakes.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.172
If I take a look at the API,
pretty simple, and

00:00:36.172 --> 00:00:38.506
seems to have the data we want, too.

00:00:38.506 --> 00:00:39.660
What do you think?

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.640
&gt;&gt; Seismi's pretty cool, but what it is
is a visualization of earthquake data.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.170
Ironically, it's getting its
data from the USGS itself.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.528
So given that, I'm going to recommend we
just go with the USGS as our API source.

00:00:51.528 --> 00:00:52.210
&gt;&gt; I didn't know that.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.930
But looking at this
documentation from the USGS,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.680
it looks pretty straightforward and
not too hard to read.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.750
Let me scan down here a little bit.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.512
Actually, it looks like this
query section is really powerful.

00:01:03.512 --> 00:01:05.767
There's actually some really
interesting queries we could do.

00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:09.301
It looks like we can search by time,
specify date and time ranges for

00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:10.960
earthquakes.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.480
This looks actually really great.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.930
You can actually search for
earthquakes based on a geographical

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.270
region that you either
specify as a rectangle.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.360
Or yeah, here's a classic one,
where you can search for

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.830
earthquakes based on a radius.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'd love to restrict the search
results to Nevada in the 1960s,

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.610
and see what comes back.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.240
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, there was a lot
of action going on back then.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.400
&gt;&gt; Well, it looks like we've got
the data that we're looking for for

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.740
our app, I see depth and
magnitude sorting options.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.840
Seems pretty powerful.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.370
I think it'd be a good candidate for
the app.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.020
&gt;&gt; Looks good.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.100
I think this API looks solid,
and we should give it a try.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.360
&gt;&gt; All right, why don't we do it?
