00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.560
So Joe, we're going to build
this earthquake app, but

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.050
where should we start?

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.030
&gt;&gt; Well, every great app starts
with having a clear vision for

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.970
its existence, right?

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.750
In this case,
we'd like to enable users like you

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.520
to get a better sense of the seismic
activity near them, or around the world.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.470
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.060
&gt;&gt; But our idea for an app could be many
other things, like a meme creator, or

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.830
a restaurant finder, or
even a task management app.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.470
At the end of the day, it should
be something that adds value and

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.700
is a joy to use.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.190
Otherwise, why distribute it?

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.990
So I guess we should get really
crisp on what kind of information

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.610
we want to show and what kind of
controls we want to give to the user.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.380
&gt;&gt; Yes, indeed.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.850
In app-speak, we call this
designing a killer user experience.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.820
&gt;&gt; I had some ideas too.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.750
Do you want to see some sketches?

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.290
&gt;&gt; Absolutely,
nice work on the napkins by the way.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.450
Super scrappy.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.315
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know how it is.

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:49.930
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.570
&gt;&gt; It's a pretty simple idea, actually.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.940
We display a list of earthquakes and we
highlight the magnitude of each one, and

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.100
we share some important information
about where and when it occurred.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.610
&gt;&gt; Very cool, I love it.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.970
Giving prominence to the magnitude here
makes sense and you got location and

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.349
date and time.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:09.690
It'd also be a great idea to sort the
results by maybe magnitude or recency.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.710
&gt;&gt; Or how about allowing the user to
focus in certain locations around

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.310
the world?

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.040
Okay cool, so, where can we find
a reliable source of earthquake data?

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.525
&gt;&gt; We can just grab
data from the Internet.

00:01:21.525 --> 00:01:25.300
&gt;&gt; Okay, but when I Google search,
all I'm getting are a bunch of websites.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.330
How can I use that in an app?

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.110
&gt;&gt; Let's modify that
search a little bit.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.162
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:29.162 --> 00:01:31.725
&gt;&gt; You'll want to add web API in there.

00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:34.398
&gt;&gt; API, what's that?

00:01:34.398 --> 00:01:39.070
&gt;&gt; API is just short hand for
Application Programming Interface.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.930
It's how a software product or service
makes certain parts of its functionality

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.250
or data available to
use in other software.

00:01:46.478 --> 00:01:49.910
It's the app's way of saying,
if you want to build something new using

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.950
some of our data or functionality,
here's how we can work together.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.590
&gt;&gt; Cool, it sounds really powerful.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.900
&gt;&gt; Yes it is, totally.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.850
It's like a programmatic
partnership that when done well,

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.589
can create some serious value,
even impact the world.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.830
When you see apps posting to Twitter or
Facebook or

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.460
displaying housing prices
on a Google map or

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.700
live streaming video, taking credit
card payments to an online store,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.680
even mustering users to aid in disaster
relief, they're all probably using APIs.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.770
And the possibilities and

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.179
problems that can be solved
with them seem to be endless.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.540
&gt;&gt; Okay Joe, I don't know.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.450
I'm pretty pumped, but in our case,
we're looking for an API that can

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.330
integrate information about earthquakes
from the Internet into our app.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.620
&gt;&gt; Yup, exactly.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.910
But the process we'll be following can
be used for all kinds of app ideas.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.840
&gt;&gt; Hey, Joe, check this out.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.070
I think I found just the one.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.000
For this quiz,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.670
what are some possible places to find
earthquake data on the Internet?

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.190
Do a search, and
find at least two websites, and

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.140
put them in the field here.
