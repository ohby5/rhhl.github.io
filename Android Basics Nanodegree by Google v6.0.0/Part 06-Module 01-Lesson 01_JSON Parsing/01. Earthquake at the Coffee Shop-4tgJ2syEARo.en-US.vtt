00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.776
Hey Chris, what are you looking at?

00:00:02.776 --> 00:00:05.040
&gt;&gt; Hey Katherine, checking out
this fantastic snow report app.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.960
I think it's time to
head to the mountains.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.800
&gt;&gt; Cool.
&gt;&gt; What are you up to?

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.560
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm heading to New York, so

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.660
I just want to check that
my flight is on time.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.410
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.160
Joe, what's going on over there?

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.676
&gt;&gt; I'm just catching up on the latest
celebrity tirade on Twitter.

00:00:16.676 --> 00:00:18.154
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Nice.

00:00:18.154 --> 00:00:19.720
How about you, Jessica?

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.070
&gt;&gt; I'm still playing with
the Miwok app we made.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.430
But there's one thing that's
bugging me about it though.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.170
&gt;&gt; What's that?

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.640
&gt;&gt; Well with all the apps you're using,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.350
they all retrieve data
from the Internet.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.890
But with the Miwok app we had to
know all the words ahead of time.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.810
&gt;&gt; That's true.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
what if we want to create an app

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.080
that displayed data about information
we can't know ahead of time?

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.534
So things like the weather, or-
&gt;&gt; [SOUND] My gosh.

00:00:40.534 --> 00:00:41.868
What was that?

00:00:41.868 --> 00:00:43.514
It's an earthquake, get down.

00:00:43.514 --> 00:00:48.464
&gt;&gt; [SOUND] No, my latte.

00:00:48.464 --> 00:00:50.900
&gt;&gt; Earthquake tweet.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.640
&gt;&gt; Joe,
how can you be tweeting right now?

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.000
The ground is literally moving.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.860
&gt;&gt; It's okay, just breath Chris.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.960
Sometimes this happens in California.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.648
Wait, I think it just stopped.

00:01:01.648 --> 00:01:08.329
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:12.327
&gt;&gt; Whoa, I am definitely going
to need another cup of coffee.

00:01:12.327 --> 00:01:13.830
&gt;&gt; Are you okay, Chris?

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.200
&gt;&gt; I think that was my first earthquake.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.440
How strong do you think that was?

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.410
&gt;&gt; That was pretty strong.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.660
Let me check.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.260
Actually, this could make
a really good app idea.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah, what would it do?

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.540
&gt;&gt; Well it could show you like
the recent earthquakes in the world,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.550
like this one.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.160
you could use it to make a more informed
decision about where you want to live.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess so.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.220
But seriously, if we were
going to build an app like this,

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.280
well we would need the earthquake data.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.420
But then how would we
get it onto the phone?

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.740
&gt;&gt; You know,
I think Joe could help us out with this.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.960
He seems to know a thing or
two about networking.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.620
We can pull data into an app
just like we browse the web.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.620
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.490
In this next course, you're going to
be building an earthquake app.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.990
I'm going to let Chris and
Joe guide you along the way.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.870
&gt;&gt; Sounds a like of fun Joe.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.410
Let's get started.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.794
&gt;&gt; Building an earthquake app, #ohyeah.
