00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.850
Welcome to
the Android Basics Nanodegree.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.610
My name is Chris and
I'm a curriculum lead here at Udacity.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.820
&gt;&gt; And my name is Catherine and
I'm a developer advocate at Google.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.306
&gt;&gt; There are over 1.4 billion
active Android devices today.

00:00:14.306 --> 00:00:17.070
So becoming ian Android developer
means being able to build software

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.300
that can reach and impact the lives
of tons of users around the world.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is a pretty incredible
time in history because mobile apps

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.870
are changing the way that we live and
work.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.120
So we're super excited that
you're taking the first step

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.700
to becoming a developer.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.500
For this Nanodegree, you don't
need any programming experience.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.585
If you know how to use a computer and
a smartphone you're ready to go.

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:36.486
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.

00:00:36.486 --> 00:00:38.340
No programming experience needed.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.386
So if you've ever had
an awesome idea for an app but

00:00:40.386 --> 00:00:43.590
didn't know how to get started,
then this is the program for you.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.390
&gt;&gt; We'll walk you through how to
build several simple Android apps.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.980
And along the way you'll learn
the Java programming language.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.840
And also some key computer
science concepts.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're going to focus
on what's important and

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.460
how to directly apply what you've
learned to the apps you're building.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.040
&gt;&gt; It's going to be challenging and
that's expected.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.780
But that's why we're going to teach
you how to think like a developer.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.325
We'll explain the decisions that
arise when building an app.

00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:08.552
You'll learn how to read documentation,
search for online resources,

00:01:08.552 --> 00:01:09.787
plan out your tests.

00:01:09.787 --> 00:01:11.643
And also figure out how to get unstuck.

00:01:11.643 --> 00:01:13.986
&gt;&gt; And signature to every
Nanodegree experience,

00:01:13.986 --> 00:01:16.970
you'll also have the opportunity
to complete projects on your own.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.400
And get invaluable
feedback on your code.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.003
&gt;&gt; And by the end of the program, you'll
have completed a whole portfolio of apps

00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:24.250
that you can share with your family and
friends.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.413
&gt;&gt; We hope that you become
inspired to learn more and

00:01:26.413 --> 00:01:27.796
go on to build some great apps.

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:29.244
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go get started.

00:01:29.244 --> 00:01:29.820
&gt;&gt; Let's do it.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.674
