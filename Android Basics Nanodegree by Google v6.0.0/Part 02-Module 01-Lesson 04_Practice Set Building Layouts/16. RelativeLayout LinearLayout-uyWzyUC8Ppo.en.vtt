00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.075
Great, so you've actually finished step one.

00:00:03.075 --> 00:00:06.750
Now that we have these two TextViews and this ImageView,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.665
we should decide roughly how we're going to get them to the correct place on the screen.

00:00:10.665 --> 00:00:14.054
All right. So, on to step two, positioning.

00:00:14.054 --> 00:00:17.130
When you're thinking about positioning the first question you should

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.990
always ask yourself is what ViewGroup you should use?

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.765
Speaking of which, what ViewGroup should you use?

00:00:23.765 --> 00:00:26.230
You only know about two of them,

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.480
so which is it?

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.660
Linear layout or relative layout.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.130
Also, go ahead and back your opinion up with facts,

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.480
tell me why your choice is the best choice.
