00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.595
Thank you for adding your video to the card showcase.

00:00:02.595 --> 00:00:04.350
It's really going to help the next generation of

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.800
Android students to see what you did and then try doing it themselves.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.030
As for me, I'm going to show this to someone special. Hey, Ben.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.125
Hey, how's it going?

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:14.250
Happy birthday.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.270
Thank you so much.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.145
Yes. Actually, I made this for you.

00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:19.110
Oh, I remember this picture.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.415
I'm glad you like it.

00:00:20.415 --> 00:00:22.170
Yes. Actually making this card,

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.510
it really helped me learn a lot more about view groups,

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.610
and layouts, and it really helped our students too.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.185
You know who would love this as my mom.

00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:30.260
I'm going to go show this to my mom.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.330
Oh, wait, wait Ben, that's my work phone.
