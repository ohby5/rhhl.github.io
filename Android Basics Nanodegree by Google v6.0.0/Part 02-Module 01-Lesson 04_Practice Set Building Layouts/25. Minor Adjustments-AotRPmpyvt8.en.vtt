00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.650
All right, so were actually two
correct answers to this question and

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.580
they were padding and layout_margin.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.850
So you could have select either one
of these but you don't need both.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.460
Let me show you why.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.030
In practice, a lot of times,
a view that uses

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.830
padding will look very similar to
a view that uses layout_margin.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.550
Let me actually draw
the view borders for you.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.148
Once you draw the view borders,

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:26.651
you could actually see the difference
between these two situations.

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:27.815
In the case of padding,

00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:31.438
you're making the actual view larger
by adding space inside of The view.

00:00:32.494 --> 00:00:35.875
In the case of layout_margin,
you're adding space around the view, but

00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:37.685
not actually changing
the size of the view.

00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:42.185
Now, you might be wondering when
does this even come into play?

00:00:42.185 --> 00:00:44.375
Why have two different attributes?

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:47.655
Well, if I were to do something
like add a border or a background

00:00:47.655 --> 00:00:51.080
color to both of these views,
they'd actually look pretty different.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.190
In our case, though, we're not adding
a border or background color, so

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.060
you can pick either padding or
layout_margin.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.260
It just wouldn't make
sense to pick both.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.050
Since we can choose either, I'm going to
go ahead and, a bit arbitrarily,

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.700
choose to add padding.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.110
Let's see what this would
look like in Android Studio.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.990
All right,
here we are back in activity_main.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.990
Now the padding attribute is something
that we want to add to the TextViews

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.790
to move them farther away
from the side of the screen.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.580
Padding and layout_margin
add space on all four sides.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.680
All right, let's go ahead and add it.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.090
And remember, I said that I wanted
there to be 20dp on all sides, so

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.110
that's what I'm putting
right here as the value.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.990
My preview is updated to
show the added space,

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.710
I'm going to go ahead and scroll down.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.654
All right, and I'm feeling a little bit
playful, so I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:34.654 --> 00:01:37.880
add layout_margin to this
TextView instead of padding.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.520
All right, and
that also scooted the TextView out.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.150
Notice, though,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.370
that the TextView's size didn't increase
when I changed the layout_margin,

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.040
whereas up here in this TextView, the
size of the actual TextView has changed.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.780
Now what happens if I add both
layout_margin and padding.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.350
Let's take a look.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.226
Well, now my text is
40dp away from the wall.

00:01:58.226 --> 00:02:02.244
It's 20dp here and
then another 20dp of padding here.

00:02:02.244 --> 00:02:04.322
All right, but
we don't want 40dp away from the wall.

00:02:04.322 --> 00:02:05.822
So I'm going to go ahead and
delete this.

00:02:07.634 --> 00:02:10.780
Okay, 20dp of padding in the From,
Lyla TextView.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.020
And 20dp of padding and
the Happy Birthday, Ben text view.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.460
Awesome, let's run this on our phone.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.970
All right, and may I present to you
the finished Birthday Card app.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:20.910
Let's get some jazz hands.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.780
And with that, we complete
the last thing in our to-do list.
