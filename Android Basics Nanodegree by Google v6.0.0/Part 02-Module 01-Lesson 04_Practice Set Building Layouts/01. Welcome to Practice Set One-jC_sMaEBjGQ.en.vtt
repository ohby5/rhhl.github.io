00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.880
Hey there.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.620
Welcome to the first practice set.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.120
After every lesson, you're going
to have practice sets with me

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.210
to review what you learned in
the lesson, and make some cool stuff.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.890
I bring four practice exercises to
instill what you've learned so far.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.290
So first,
you're going to install Android Studio,

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.830
which is a program that professional
developers use to make Android apps.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.700
Following that, you'll make
your very first Android app and

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.430
load it up on your phone.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.410
Once you're done with that,

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.870
I'm going to walk you through how to
make a simple birthday card application.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.020
Finally, you'll make you
own custom card app and

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.210
show other students your design process.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.540
Well, no time like
the present to get started.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.035
So grab a cup of coffee [SOUND]
and get to code.
