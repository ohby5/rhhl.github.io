00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.000
All right.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.835
So during the last video,
I already showed you how to download

00:00:03.835 --> 00:00:06.930
androidparty.jpg and
how to move it into the drawable folder.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.670
If you're having difficulty with these
two, go ahead and rewatch the videos, or

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.960
go to the forums and
ask other students for help.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.000
The rest of these,
we're going to go ahead and

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.050
do in Android Studio right now.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.410
Okay, so this is my happy
birthday application code.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.900
Specifically, I'm looking at the file
activitymain.xml, which is inside of

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.490
the layout folder, right here, so make
sure you're looking at the same file.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.049
Now one of the things that we needed
to do was remove the padding, and

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.870
I showed you how to do this in
the video but I'm going to do it again.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.470
These four attributes right here,

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.940
I'm not really interested
in having right now.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.680
Okay, so that was pretty easy.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.800
The next I want to do is go ahead and
make another TextView.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.650
That should be super easy because I
already have a TextView right here that

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.610
I can model it off of.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.268
I'm in fact going to go ahead and
copy this TextView and paste.

00:00:51.268 --> 00:00:55.830
Now the TextView I'm adding is supposed
to say from, and then your name.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.170
So I'm going to change that right now,
and

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.070
I changed this specific attribute
because it's the text attribute.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.230
Okay so
I've done two out of the four things.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.580
Now I'm going to go ahead and
add the ImageView.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.600
Now I don't have an ImageView
to copy off of, so

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.610
I'm just going to start typing.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.520
If you don't remember what an ImageView
looks like you can go ahead and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.610
check out the XML cheat sheet
that we've provided for you.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.150
One of the neat things
that Android Studio does

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.290
is when you start typing something it'll
pop up with a little auto-complete menu.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.420
Since what I wanted was an ImageView I'm
going to go ahead and click on it.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.172
Well this is super helpful, because it
gave me the android:layout_width and

00:01:30.172 --> 00:01:33.980
android:layout_height attributes
without me needing to type them.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.270
I'm going to go ahead right now and

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.760
just make these wrap_content
just like the TextViews.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.610
And you can see how I don't even need to
finish typing, I can just click on it.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.430
Okay, now if we go over here and look
at the phone preview, I can see that it

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.970
says Happy Birthday and I can just
barely see that it says from Lyla.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.840
So, these two TextViews seem to be
displayed somewhat correctly but

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.310
I'm not getting any sort
of image down here.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.060
That's because I still need to define
the source attribute of the image view.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.090
After all, I haven't said what
picture I actually want to show.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.430
So I'm going to go ahead and
start typing that right now.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.890
I'll start with android, again,
the auto complete pops up with src,

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.880
so to save on typing I'll go ahead and
click it.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.940
The auto complete even guesses
what should come next.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.880
And if you remember from the lecture,
I need to type @drawable.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.970
Now the question is,
what comes after here?

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.560
Well what comes after here is the name
of the picture that I want to display,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.370
and more importantly that picture
has to exist in the drawable folder.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.630
So over here, inside the rows folder,
inside the drawable folder,

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.680
I have androidparty.jpg,
which is the image that I moved over.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.540
This is the image that I want to use.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.160
It's in the correct place.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.200
All I need to do is type the name
without the file extension,

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.660
which would be androidparty.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.220
Okay, and almost immediately you
should see that the picture appears.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.090
Now this is looking pretty good,
so great job so far.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.910
But before you move on,
you should always,

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.220
always, always,
actually run your app on your phone.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.507
So I'm going to do that by coming
up here to the green run button.

00:03:05.507 --> 00:03:08.576
And clicking on it, it's going
to think for a little bit, and

00:03:08.576 --> 00:03:11.450
I could see that it's
processing down here.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.740
Okay, and once this window pops up,

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.650
as long as my phone is plugged into
my computer and everything is set up

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.090
like we showed before, I should be able
to select the phone, and then hit OK.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.040
Okay, so
this is actually pretty awesome.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.520
Our phone looks a lot like the example
phone that we have down here.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.645
We got ImageView,
we got our two Text Views up here.

00:03:31.645 --> 00:03:34.336
And we pretty much confirmed
everything's working as expected at

00:03:34.336 --> 00:03:35.200
this point.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.140
Just going through the checklist items
I've added a TextView that says,

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.850
&gt;From Lyla.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.361
I've also added the androidparty
ImageView right here.

00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:46.397
I went ahead and
removed that extra default padding and

00:03:46.397 --> 00:03:49.050
I click the green arrow and ran my app.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.740
Neat.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.470
So at this point you're
ready to move on and

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.880
fix this pesky little problem where
our views are overlapping one another.
