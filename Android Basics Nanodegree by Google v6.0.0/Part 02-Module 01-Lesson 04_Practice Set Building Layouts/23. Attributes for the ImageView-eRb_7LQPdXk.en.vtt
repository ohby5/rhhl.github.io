00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.410
We're already displaying the correct
image, which is this Android party

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.790
image, so there's no need to
change the source attribute.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.790
Similarly, the position
isn't really incorrect.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.920
The image just needs to be larger, so

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.710
all of these layout aligned parent
attributes, we're not going to use them.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.450
Using the id attribute in and

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.000
of itself doesn't actually make
any changes to the layout.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.750
It just give the view a name so
that you can refer to it later.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.250
Now there's actually a way to use
the background attribute to achieve

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.980
the effect we're trying to achieve.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.300
But it doesn't involve an image view.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.140
So if you chose background,
you're technically correct, but

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.010
we're going to go about
it in a different way.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.060
The way that we learned
about in the lesson.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.400
This leaves us with layout_height,
layout_width, and ScaleType.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.340
ScaleType will change the size of
the image within the view box that

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.380
surrounds it.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.546
While layout_width and

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:49.940
layout_height will actually
change the size of that view box.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.530
In this case, the image is large enough
that the view box expands to fill

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.740
the entire screen no matter if it's
wrapped content or matched parent.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.430
Because it doesn't matter
in this particular case

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.790
whether we put matched parent or

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.220
wrapped content you don't strictly
need to change these, in this case.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.530
That said, because we are trying to get
the view to expand to the entire screen,

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.350
it would probably be good to set
these explicitly as match parent.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.820
Then, if we end up
using a smaller image,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.260
it will still expand to
fill the entire screen.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.940
But while layout height and layout width
are sort of optional in this case,

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.660
scale type is the actual attribute that
you're absolutely going to need to use

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.330
to make the image fill
the entire screen.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.930
The question is,
we've chosen the attribute, but

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.900
we don't know the value
to set scale type to.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.710
And that's what I want you to
figure out in the next question.
