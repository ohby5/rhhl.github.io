Writing code in an Internet
browser is fine, but

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.030
you're probably wondering what kind of
tools professional developers use and

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.350
how you get something like
this actually onto your phone.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.730
This installation comes in two parts.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.190
First, we're going to install something
called the Java Development Kit and

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.240
only once we're done with that,
then will we install Android Studio.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.300
I want you to think of
Android Studio like a workshop.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.320
And this is a pretty special workshop
because it's specifically designed for

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.250
making Android applications.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.930
One where we have automated help
that makes creating apps easier.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.900
The thing is, that while this workshop
is great, it's pretty useless without

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.590
tools and that's where
the Java Development Kit comes in.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.670
Before we set anything else up, first
we'll install the Java Development Kit.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.900
Essentially we're grabbing our tools.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.090
Then we set up our app making workshop
by installing Android Studio.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.735
Now it's important that you
do these steps in order and

00:00:50.735 --> 00:00:52.075
complete them correctly.

00:00:52.075 --> 00:00:54.835
If you don't have your tools ready then
you won't be able to do anything in

00:00:54.835 --> 00:00:56.315
your workshop.

00:00:56.315 --> 00:00:59.525
The whole process of setting both of
these up, should take you about 30

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:02.255
minutes to an hour if your
Internet connection is fast.

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:03.115
Okay, let's get started.
