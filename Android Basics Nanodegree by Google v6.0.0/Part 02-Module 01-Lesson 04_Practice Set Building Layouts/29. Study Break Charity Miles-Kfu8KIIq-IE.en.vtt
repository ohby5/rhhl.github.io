00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.050
My name is Gene Gurkoff, and
I'm the founder of Charity Miles.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.933
Charity Miles is a free app that
allows people to earn money for

00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:08.050
charity whenever they walk,
run, or bike.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.257
I was a finance lawyer for a number of
years, and when I was in law school,

00:00:11.257 --> 00:00:14.992
before that I started running marathons
to raise money for Parkinson's research,

00:00:14.992 --> 00:00:17.220
in honor of my grandfather
who has Parkinson's.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.137
And I figured if I got
enough people together,

00:00:19.137 --> 00:00:21.560
then collectively we would
have the clout of a celebrity.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.300
And then companies would
want to sponsor us.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.067
The first technological project that
I worked on was actually while I was

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:26.710
still a lawyer.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.038
And I thought it would be really cool if
we could make something where we could

00:00:30.038 --> 00:00:33.220
crowdsource what we think the law should
be and it totally failed [LAUGH].

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.590
But it was a really good experience.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.701
If you're going to create an app or
you're going to be an entrepreneur,

00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:41.150
in any field, I think there
are many moments of failure.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.990
How you spin those failures
into a learning lesson or

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.800
a success that I think
are the most important.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.010
I never would have thought of
Charity Miles if I hadn't had failures.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.540
Before I got the engineers I
talked to a lot of people.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.280
Just ran the idea by them just
to see what they thought.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.550
Then I got the developers and we worked
on wireframing and designing everything.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.160
All these features that,
you know, we had in there,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.170
crammed in there, we are going to
take that out, take that out, so

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.500
we ended up with something
that just did one thing.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.355
We just choose from over 30
world-class organizations from

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:18.090
Wounded Warrior Project to Feeding
America to World Wildlife Fund, ASPCA.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.397
I'm going to choose the Michael J Fox's
Foundation for Parkinson's Research,

00:01:21.397 --> 00:01:22.590
in honor of my grandfather.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.734
And then we're going to go for
an outdoor walk, and

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:29.610
now thanks to Johnson &amp; Johnson,
we're able to earn money for

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.920
Michael J Fox Foundation for
every mile that we walk.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.909
And this little mile counter down here
shows us how far we have walked and

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.350
if we press this we can see more so
we can again see how far we've walked.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.940
And we can also in real time, the amount
of money that we've raised for

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.880
the Michael J Fox foundation.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.620
And you know,
every mile really does matter.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.490
So, as you continue to walk, you'll be
earning more money to cure Parkinson's.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.360
And if you scroll down,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.799
you can get a little bit more
information about Johnson &amp; Johnson and

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.640
the other things that they're
doing to support great charities.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.460
And when you're done, you just press the
stop button and finish, and that's it.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.550
Very simple.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.482
Whether you're a social good app or just
an app, try to create value versus hype.

00:02:12.482 --> 00:02:14.070
Try to create an app
that makes people happy,

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.930
that makes people healthy,
that improves life somehow.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.500
You're going to have to tell investors
about it, you're going to have to tell

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.270
your family about it, you're going to
have to tell your friends about it.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.860
And if it's not something you love
then it's going to be really boring.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.390
I never get tired of talking about
Charity Miles because I love it, and

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.250
I feel good about being able
to share this with people.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.860
So I think it would be great if the next
generation of entrepreneurs could

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.670
use apps to harness the power of crowds
to drive major advances in science.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.370
The phone has so much on it from
the accelerometer to the GPS that it's

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.500
monitoring all this data
about us all the time.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.450
And that data is super critical for
Alzheimer's, for asthma, for

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.010
heart disease those being able to
use phones and apps to crowdsource.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.600
That type of scientific is
going to change the game.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.700
I would tell potential developers
to do something that they love.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.390
It's the thrill of a lifetime,
they should do it.
