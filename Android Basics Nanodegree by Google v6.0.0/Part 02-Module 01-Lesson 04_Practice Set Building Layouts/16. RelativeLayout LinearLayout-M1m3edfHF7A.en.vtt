00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.795
To answer this question, let's compare
the two so that you can choose.

00:00:04.795 --> 00:00:08.620
LinearLayouts are great for
aligning views in rows or columns.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.840
They're a good way to divide up
one space using layout weights

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.590
that will expand or shrink views
depending on the size of the display.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.615
On the other hand,
RelativeLayouts are great for

00:00:17.615 --> 00:00:20.200
positioning elements
relative to one another.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.450
For example, putting B below A, or
putting C in the lower left-hand corner.

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:28.600
RelativeLayouts also make
it easy to overlap views.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.551
For example,
here view A is overlapping view B.

00:00:31.551 --> 00:00:35.545
For our card, we don't really have
a line of horizontal or vertical views.

00:00:35.545 --> 00:00:38.169
And as you can see,
some of these views overlap.

00:00:38.169 --> 00:00:41.686
So in this case,
a RelativeLayout makes a lot more sense.

00:00:41.686 --> 00:00:43.109
And with a RelativeLayout,

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:47.080
I can use specific attributes
to position these two TextViews.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.230
Instead of talking about
all that here though,

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.480
you'll tell me what do in
the next few questions.
