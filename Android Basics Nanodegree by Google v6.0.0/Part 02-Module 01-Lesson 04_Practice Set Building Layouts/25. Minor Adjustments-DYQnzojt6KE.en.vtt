00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.340
We've got one small issue
that I'd like you to solve.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.160
Right now all the text is smushed up
in the corner of the phone screen,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.150
both in the upper left corner and
the lower right corner.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.380
In our end version we want to
give it a little bit more space.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.180
In the same style as before, select the
attribute or attributes that you need to

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.250
change to make room between the side
of the phone screen and the text.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.060
Once you've selected
the correct attribute or

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.440
attributes, make this
space 20 dp on all sides.
