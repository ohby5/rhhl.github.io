00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.800
All right, so it's actually
the appropriately named textSize

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.939
that will make the text larger.

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:07.510
Now maybe you thought it was textStyle.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.620
TextStyle is actually
an attribute that's used for

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.590
changing text to either bold or italic.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.470
But it doesn't change the size.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.180
You might have been
looking at textAlignment,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.010
which does things like puts
the text to the left of the view or

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.180
the right of the view,
or centered in the view.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.070
But it is actually textSize,
so once we've determined this,

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.640
let's go ahead and
make the changes in the code.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.570
All right, here I am, in my code.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.090
I'm looking at activity main.xml
like I always have been and

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.290
I'm going to scroll down so
I can see my two TextViews.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.660
Okay, So let's go ahead and
add the attribute.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.490
Put Android,
the name of the attribute equals.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.510
Okay, and now I have to put the value.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.520
And if you remember from the quiz
question the value should be 36sp.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.300
As always, remember to have
quotes around your value.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.670
And you're going to need android:
before the value textSize.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.580
Oh yeah, and
don't forget the equals sign.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.860
Once you've done this, you should be
able to go over here to the preview

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.930
screen and see that the text
has actually gotten bigger.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.700
Let's go ahead and
make this text larger as well.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.250
Okay, great.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.610
And I've typed my textSize="36sp" here.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.260
And I see that it in fact,
updated on the phone.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.980
But, in reality,
this isn't your actual phone.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.240
So you should always, always,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.940
always run it on your phone to
make sure it looks correct.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.905
To do that, I go up here to the green
run button, select my phone and hit OK.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.330
And good work, you've done it.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.680
We no longer have small microtext,
we have big and

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.720
beautiful 36 sp text
displayed on our phone.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.000
And just like that, we can check off
text is much larger on our list.
