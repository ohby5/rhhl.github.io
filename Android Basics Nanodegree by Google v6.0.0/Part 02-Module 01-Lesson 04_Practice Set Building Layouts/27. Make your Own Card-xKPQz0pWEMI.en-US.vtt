Thank you for
adding your video to the card showcase.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.460
It's really going to help the next
generation of Android students to see

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.010
what you did, and
then try doing it themselves.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.270
As for me, I'm going to show
this to someone special.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.070
Hey Ben,
&gt;&gt; Hey, how's it going?

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.220
&gt;&gt; Happy Birthday!

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.170
&gt;&gt; Thank you, so much.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually I made this for you
&gt;&gt; Oh, I remember this picture.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.470
&gt;&gt; I'm glad you like it.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.910
Actually, making this card, it really
helped me learn a lot more about view

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.560
groups and layouts and
it really helped our students too.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.170
&gt;&gt; You know who would
love this is my mom.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.680
I'm going to go show this to my mom.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.280
&gt;&gt; Wait, wait Ben, that's my work phone.
