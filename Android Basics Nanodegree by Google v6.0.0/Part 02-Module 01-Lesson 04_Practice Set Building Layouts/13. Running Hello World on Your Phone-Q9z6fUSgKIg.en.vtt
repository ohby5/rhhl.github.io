00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.110
Right now we see a picture of a phone.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.740
But this isn't actually on our phone.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.410
This is pretty similar to when we
were working with the XML visualizer.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.170
Now we actually want to
see our app on our phone.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.034
To participate, you're going
to need a USB cable like this.

00:00:16.295 --> 00:00:20.575
Now this USB cable should fit your
Android phone, which you will also need.

00:00:20.575 --> 00:00:21.565
What do I mean by fit?

00:00:21.565 --> 00:00:26.005
Well, I can pick up my phone and
plug this cable into it.

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:27.195
Now if you don't have these things,

00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:30.140
there's a slightly more complicated
way you can get up and running.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.835
Which I'm going to talk
about in the next video.

00:00:31.835 --> 00:00:34.540
But, if you have both of these items,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.183
I really encourage you to use a real
device, its a lot more fun that way.

00:00:38.183 --> 00:00:39.660
All right.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.710
First things, first.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.470
Your phone is not set up to let random
code from your computer run on your

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.030
phone by default.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.410
So you're going to need to do
a few steps to prep your phone.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.130
Okay, so
the first step is to become a developer.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.500
This sounds a little funny, when would
you know when you're a developer?

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.010
Well, what this actually means is
changing around a couple of settings on

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.670
the phone, which will alow you
to access developer options.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.390
Once your phone's set up, you'll
connect your phone to your computer

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.440
using the USB cable that
I talked about before.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.790
Now if you're using a Windows machine,
the third step for

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.140
you, in Windows only,
will be to install a driver.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.970
And a driver is an extra little bit
of software that will allow your

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.679
phone to communicate with
your Windows machine.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.740
With Macs, this just works by default,
so you don't have to worry about it.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.810
And finally, you'll install your app.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.810
Alright, let's stop doing these steps.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.060
On newer phones,
running Android 4.2 and later,

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.140
you'll need to tell your
phone you're a developer.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.140
This is a pretty simple process
that I'll show you right now.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.592
The way to do this is to
navigate to the Settings menu.

00:01:41.318 --> 00:01:45.470
Once you're here, scroll down to
the bottom and click on About phone.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.040
On this menu,
also scroll down to the bottom.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.490
You should see something
that says Build number.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.930
Okay, so take the build number and
click it 7 times.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.090
Cool.

00:02:00.095 --> 00:02:02.070
So now suddenly, you're a developer.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.710
Wasn't that easy?

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.300
Once you're done, go ahead and
hit the back button.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.169
Now because of your new fancy title as
a developer, you should notice that

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.570
the phone has provided you with
a new option, the developer options.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.360
Go ahead and click on that.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.530
Okay, now in developer options there's
a bunch of fancy sounding options, but

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.950
what I want you to do is scroll
down until you see USB debugging.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.350
And then go ahead and

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.100
click the little check box next
to USB debugging to turn it on.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.650
And say OK.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.690
By checking this box,

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.010
it's allowing your computer to
put applications onto your phone.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.010
Awesome.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.200
Now that you've enabled that,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.180
you can take your handy dandy USB cable,
plug one end into the phone, and

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.630
take the other end and
plug it into your computer.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.720
If you're on a Windows device,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.470
there's one more step to set
up your phone and computer.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.410
Your Windows machine needs some software
called the driver to communicate

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.410
with your phone.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.470
I'll start by downloading the driver.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.920
For most phones besides
Google Nexus phones,

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.610
you can navigate to the Android OEM,
which stands for

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.890
original equipment manufacturers,
driver website.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.750
A link is provided in
the instructor notes.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.010
I'm going to scroll down to the bottom.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.170
Here I have a list of drivers for
different phones, and

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.840
I will go ahead and
download the appropriate one.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.020
In my case, I have a nexus phone, so

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.530
I'm going to go up on the page,
and click google USB driver.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.200
This is again, for Nexus phones.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.873
Okay, so for me, I'm going to go ahead
and download the google USB driver,

00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:39.740
Unzip it,
I'm going to move this to my desktop.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.410
So at this point, I've downloaded
the driver, i've unzipped it and

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.450
I've put it on my desktop.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.440
What you need to do next is double check
that your phone is actually plugged in.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.300
Okay let's look at our task bar.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.850
I'm going to click on the start menu and
go to computer.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.340
In Windows Explorer I'm going to
right-click on the word here that

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.960
says computer.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.190
And then I'll go to manage.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.500
In this left pane here,
I'm going to select device manager, so

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.100
looking through this list, go ahead and

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.180
find the thing that says
other devices and expand it.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.270
Now you should see something
here that refers to your phone.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.111
For example, NexusS, or ADB,

00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:22.330
which stands for
android debug bridge, interface.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.715
OK.
Okay, so I'm going to right-click and

00:04:24.715 --> 00:04:27.035
select update driver software.

00:04:27.035 --> 00:04:29.565
This is going to launch a wizard
that looks like this, and

00:04:29.565 --> 00:04:32.305
I want to select the one that let's me
browse my computer, because remember,

00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:34.415
I just downloaded it to my desktop.

00:04:34.415 --> 00:04:38.260
I'm going to do browse computer, and
I'm going to go ahead and click browse.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.650
And I'm going to go to my desktop and
hit OK and hit next.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.730
I might see some security
messages like this.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:45.890
Go ahead and say, install.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.960
All right.
Cool.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.890
So, this autoplay just popped up with
my Nexus 6, so that's a good sign

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.750
that now the computer's
communicating well with my phone.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.800
I'm going to go ahead and close this.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.630
And the final window of the wizard,

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.610
says that Windows has successfully
updated your driver software.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.240
So that sounds awesome.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.180
Go ahead and click close.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.250
Basically at this point,

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.600
your phone is ready to accept
the application from your computer.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.470
Another way of saying that
you can now install apps that

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.400
you've built on your computer,
onto your phone.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.408
Finally, were going to install our
Hello World App from the computer

00:05:18.408 --> 00:05:19.151
onto the phone.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.860
To do this, you're going to go
up to the top of Android Studio

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.220
to this green play button, and click it.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:31.070
It will take about ten seconds or so for
the next window to pop up so be patient.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.090
At the bottom of the screen,

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.780
you should be able to see that
there's some process being executed.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.780
Now, if everything went as planned, your
computer should detect your phone and

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.100
list it here.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.370
Make sure you have the Choose a running
device radio button clicked and

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.590
not the Launch emulator
radio button selected.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.000
If you can't see your phone,
try unplugging it and re-plugging it in.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.320
And then try restarting the phone.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.670
If that also doesn't work and

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.260
you're on a Windows machine, you might
have installed the wrong driver.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.110
If none of those solutions seem to
solve your problem, we've created

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.640
a troubleshooting document,
which is linked in the instructor notes.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.900
And you can always try asking your
fellow students for help on chat or

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:09.490
in forums.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.570
Okay, but hopefully things are working.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.570
You can select your phone and
click the OK button.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.160
After about five seconds you should
see your phone looks like this.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.593
You've now successfully run your
first android application on a phone.

00:06:22.593 --> 00:06:23.230
Awesome work.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.450
As we start thinking about our
birthday card application,

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.920
I want you to think about a friend who's
having a birthday that's coming up.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.290
Now, my challenge to you is to change
the app that we currently have

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.550
to say happy birthday and
then that person's name,

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.630
and then to run that app on your phone.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.600
Remember, you'll need to change
the main activity .xml code file

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.590
the same way we practiced changing
code in the Internet browser.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.260
Right now the text says hello world, but
you should be able to find the correct

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.860
attribute to change it to say, Happy
Birthday and then your friend's name.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.140
After you've done that,
press the green run button and

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.250
install the app on your phone.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:00.750
Good luck.
