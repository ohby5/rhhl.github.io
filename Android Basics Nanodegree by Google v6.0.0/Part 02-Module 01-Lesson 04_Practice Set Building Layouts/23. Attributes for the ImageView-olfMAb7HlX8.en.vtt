00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:00.640
All right.

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.126
So, as I mentioned, this white text
here is a little bit hard to see,

00:00:04.126 --> 00:00:07.570
but that's going to be fixed in this
next step where we're going to expand

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.150
the image view so
that it fills the entire screen and

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.050
then we'll able to see
our white text just fine.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.410
Okay.
This quiz is going to be a little

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.660
bit different.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.490
So, like before,
I want you to select the attribute or

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.000
attributes that you think you need to
use to expand the image like this.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.240
But don't worry about
changing them just yet.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.470
Just go ahead and
pick which one you think it is.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.420
You don't have to modify
the code in this quiz.
