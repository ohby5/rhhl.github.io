00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.660
All right, positioning.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.750
So this is what we have right now and

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.890
like I said before, for the most
part things are in the right place.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.570
The image seems to be pretty
much centered in the screen,

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.010
happy birthday is in
the upper-left corner.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.160
Really, the only thing that's
an issue is that From Lyla is

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.240
not in the correct place.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.600
It should be in
the lower-right hand corner.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.490
You can see here at our goal,
we've managed to move it down here.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.630
Let's go ahead and
fix this and turn it into this.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.920
To start, select the attribute or
attributes that you need to position

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.440
&gt;From Lyla in the correct
place on the screen.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.620
Namely the lower left-hand corner.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.090
Here's a list of attributes and
you can go ahead and

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.360
check next to the ones
that you think you need.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.940
Once you've done that, submit your
answer to see if it's correct.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.160
Once you know the correct attributes
to use, open up your code and

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.100
go ahead and add those attributes
to the From Lyla text view.
