00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.670
Now we're going to actually
install our workshop,

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.180
which is the Android Studio program.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.020
I suggest you watch me so that you
can have a sense of what the process

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.900
looks like, and then follow the text
version instructions at your own pace.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.460
Also, keep in mind that
these are large files.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.980
You're going to want to have a strong
and stable Internet connection.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.970
For students with slower and
more unreliable Internet,

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.100
you might want to consider finding
a wired Internet connection.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.790
Also, if things are taking
a while to load or download and

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.790
you're getting bored, feel free to go to
the next node, which has a quick review

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.750
quiz game that you can do while
Android Studio is downloading.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.050
I've created the walkthrough for

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.510
how to download Android Studio on
two different operating systems.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.230
I have instructions for Windows and
instructions for Mac computers.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.100
I'll give you a moment.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.560
Go ahead and
click on which one applies to you.

00:00:58.454 --> 00:01:02.680
Okay, I'm going to be installing
Android Studio on a Windows machine.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.019
Please note that this screen cast
was done on April 7, 2015 and

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.640
I say that just because sometimes the
screens or the icons that you might see

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.730
while installing Android studio could
change depending on what version it is.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.260
We're going to give you a text version
to go along with the screencast.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.190
Since it's easier to change the text
version than to go through re-recording

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.630
an entire screencast,

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.820
that will be a little it more up
to date than the screencast will.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.420
All right, so to start off,
go ahead and open a web browser, and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.980
go to the Android studio website.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.630
It's linked in the instruction notes,
you do not have to type this in.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.000
All right, so once you've arrived on
the site, you should see a big green

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.940
button that's pretty obvious that says
Download Android Studio for wWndows, so

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:44.650
go ahead and click that.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.163
All right and that's going to take you
to the License for Android Studio.

00:01:49.163 --> 00:01:50.990
You're welcome to go ahead and
read that.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.200
I'm going to scroll to the bottom,
sign my rights away,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.510
and then click this Download
Android Studio for Windows button.

00:01:59.102 --> 00:02:02.060
All right, we did want to download this,
so we do want to keep it.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.590
I'm going to press Keep.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.870
Okay, and if you look right here, this
is a little bit less than a gig of data.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.860
And that's about equivalent to
downloading a movie file of

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.080
reasonable quality.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.740
So you can judge how long this will
take based on your Internet connection.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.490
Okay, once it's finished downloading,
go ahead and double click the file.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.760
We did in fact want to run this.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.350
So click Run.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.290
Yes, we did want to allow
it to make changes.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.640
All right, and now we're at
the Android Studio Setup Wizard.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.200
This is going to guide you through
a collection of screens to set up

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.942
Android Studio, and pretty much always
we're going to just select the default.

00:02:34.942 --> 00:02:39.700
All right, so I'm going to hit Next,
I want all these boxes checked.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.520
Note that this requires 3.8 GB of space,
and we only download about a gigabyte,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.770
so after this, there's going
to be even more downloading.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:48.290
I'm going to hit Next.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.470
This is a license agreement here, you
can go ahead and read it if you'd like.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.000
I'm going to go ahead and hit I Agree.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.716
Oh yes, I agree more.

00:02:57.716 --> 00:03:02.611
Okay, I'm all right with all of
these standard install locations.

00:03:02.611 --> 00:03:05.460
All right,
going to say next on the emulator setup.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.410
We'll talk about this later.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.670
Sure, let's make a Start Menu folder and
I'm going to hit Install,

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.920
which will bring me to this screen.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.172
Of course, if you like staring
at loading bars feel free.

00:03:17.172 --> 00:03:18.850
All right, it looks like it completed.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.999
I can go ahead and
look at the show details.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.420
And I'm not seeing anything here
about huge errors, so that's good.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.820
All right, I'm going to go ahead and
click Next.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.800
Okay, so the install looks like
it finished, we click finish.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.600
This is the little loading screen for
Android Studio when it starts up.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.180
Okay, now this is asking me if I have
some settings from a previous version of

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.950
Android Studio, and
I'm pretty sure that you don't.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.070
So you probably want to hit the I don't
have a previous version of android

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.252
studio, or I don't want to import my
settings, and go ahead and hit OK.

00:03:51.993 --> 00:03:54.570
Just going ahead and downloading
a few more components for me.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.690
Now once you see this screen,

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.730
you know you've got
Android Studio up and running.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.250
But the real test to see if
you did everything correctly

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.210
will be if you can make
your first app using it.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.650
All right, so
this completes the installation video.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.250
And now you're going to do
this process on your own.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.570
All right, I'm going to download
Android Studio on a Mac.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.385
Note that this screen cast
was done April 6th, 2015.

00:04:17.385 --> 00:04:19.836
And the reason I'm saying
that is because sometimes,

00:04:19.836 --> 00:04:21.880
this process will change.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.160
We will always provide you
with text instructions for

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.580
the install process, and we will
keep those instructions up to date.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.860
So things look a little
different here and there.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.960
Don't worry, check out the text
install instructions and

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.850
with that little mini
note let's get started.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.680
The first thing you're going to do is
click at the instructed note below

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.070
to get to the Android studio homepage.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.450
Don't try typing this out, just click
the link in the instructor notes.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.420
Once you're here there's going to be a
pretty obvious button that says download

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.410
Android studio and it should say for
Mac, go ahead and click it.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.130
At this point you'll see a license
agreement, you can read it if you like.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.310
And then go ahead and scroll down,
click that you've read it and

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.640
then click this download
Android Studio for Mac button.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.380
Okay, so
it's started downloading here for me.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.650
Now you should be able to see that this
download is a couple hundred megabytes.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.430
Once it's downloaded,
go ahead and double-click it.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.790
You should see this big beautiful
screen that says Android studio.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.320
And as with most applications, you're
going to go ahead and click Android

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.850
studio and drag it into your
applications folder so it'll copy over.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.980
After you've successfully done that,
you can go ahead and

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.080
double click Android Studio, which will
actually try to open Android Studio.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.433
You might get a warning about it
being a download from the web.

00:05:29.433 --> 00:05:32.468
But we did mean to download this and
we did mean to run it so go ahead and

00:05:32.468 --> 00:05:33.970
click Open.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.980
This little screen should appear to
load up the installation process.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.540
All right, and
here we are at the Welcome Wizard.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.120
What follows is going to be a series
of screens and licenses and

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.820
you pretty much just want
to keep the defaults.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.240
And you click Next.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.080
This is a screen asking me where
my Java development kit is.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.860
Now, we just installed that and

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.750
it's actually making
a guess about where it is.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.920
If it isn't guessing,
you can click the Detect button.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.620
And if that isn't working, you can
try navigating your file system to go

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.690
exactly to where you downloaded it.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.820
If you're having trouble with this step,
It probably means that there were

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.300
issues with downloading
the Java Development Kit.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.160
You might have downloaded
the wrong file or

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.520
just something might not
be configured right.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.580
Try going through
the instructions again or

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.280
checking out
the troubleshooting documents.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.690
Everything seems to be working here so
I'm going to go ahead and click Next.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.500
Now we're not doing
anything too crazy so

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.130
I'm going to choose
a standard installation.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.510
Here are some of the licenses
that I was talking about.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.980
Go ahead and click on this
first license and say, Accept.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.810
That'll accept all these
licenses down here.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.410
You'll have to click on the next
license set here, and also hit Accept.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.890
And this will let you finish
the Android Studio Setup Wizard.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.559
Okay, when I click Finish, it's actually
going to download a lot of stuff.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.740
And what all of this entails is
downloading a couple gigs of data,

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.840
which is sort of a huge
amount of stuff to download.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.330
So be patient,
this might take some time.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.350
If you're getting bored of staring at
a loading bar, you can go ahead and

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:02.715
click to the next video, where we.

00:07:02.715 --> 00:07:05.733
We have a little review game to go over
some of the stuff we've already learned.

00:07:07.035 --> 00:07:10.365
As you see this window, go ahead and
type in your password, and

00:07:10.365 --> 00:07:12.855
the candy cane strips here
mean this is close to done.

00:07:14.355 --> 00:07:14.865
Awesome.
And

00:07:14.865 --> 00:07:17.620
once you're done, you see this screen.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.736
Hopefully there's a lot of positive
language like successfully,

00:07:20.736 --> 00:07:25.330
installation pass, successfully created.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.880
If you see any errors here it could
mean that there are errors with

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.250
the installation.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.140
But things look good so
I'm going to go ahead and click Finish.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.930
Now once you see this screen, you know
that you've got Android studio up and

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:36.990
running, so great job.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.930
But the real test is going to be seeing
if we did everything correctly enough

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.350
that we can create out
own apps using it.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.230
All right, so,
now you've watched me do the steps once.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.970
I want you go ahead and
download Android Studio yourself.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.570
If the downloading is taking awhile, but

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.660
you still want to be doing Android stuff
feel free to move onto the next node

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.360
where we have a review game to pass
the time while things install.
