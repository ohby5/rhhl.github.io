Alright, so at this point we know we're
going to use Scale Type to expand

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:04.720
our image.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.580
So, now what I want you to do is
actually expand the image to fill

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.000
the entire screen.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.522
Now a couple of hints on how to do this.

00:00:10.522 --> 00:00:14.620
Hint number one, now there are actually
a lot of different values that you can

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.400
set Scale Type to, but in the lesson
we only taught you about two, so

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.370
let's stick with thinking about those.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.020
The values that we know about
are center and center crop.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.730
Knowing what you know from the lesson,

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.060
which one of these do
you think we should use?

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.780
Now once you've used scale type properly
to make the image expand to the entire

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.610
screen, there's a possibility
that your text will disappear.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.220
If this happens to you, try changing
around the ordering of your views.
