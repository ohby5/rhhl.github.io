00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.730
You are blazing through these steps.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:03.542
So at this point,

00:00:03.542 --> 00:00:06.750
we've done step number one where
we've selected the correct views.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.092
We also went ahead and
did step number two and

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:12.210
we roughly positioned the views
correctly on the screen.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.892
So now it's time to move on to step
number three, styling the views, and to

00:00:15.892 --> 00:00:19.910
do that, we're going to have to figure
out what attributes we need to change.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.430
All right, so what I want you to do is
take a look at where we are right now.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.840
And take a look at where we want
to be at the end of the app.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.470
Try to figure out what the difference
is between these two states are and

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.820
then write those differences
down in a list in this text box.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.940
This will help us choose what attributes
we're ultimately going to change.
