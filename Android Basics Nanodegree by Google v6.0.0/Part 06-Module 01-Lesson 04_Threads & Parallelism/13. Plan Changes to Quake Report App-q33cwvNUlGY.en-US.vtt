00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.777
You know, Joe?

00:00:00.777 --> 00:00:03.644
I think we've put these students enough
in a tangent with the tsunami and

00:00:03.644 --> 00:00:05.490
the digifield apps, right?

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.970
&gt;&gt; Well,
I think it was a necessary tangent.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.550
There's a lot of concepts and

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.090
code changes that make an HTTP
request work in an Android app.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's totally true.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.620
&gt;&gt; I didn't want to make
the student copy and

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.100
paste a bunch of code that
they didn't understand.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.040
You guys don't want that, right?

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.350
&gt;&gt; Okay, well I think
they've got a hang of it now.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.207
They've been through a lot of concepts,
they've done a bunch of quiz questions

00:00:27.207 --> 00:00:28.857
and they've don a little bit of coding,
too.

00:00:28.857 --> 00:00:31.310
But now it's time for
the real challenge.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.229
Where they can see whether or

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.160
not they can apply all of
that to the Quake Report app.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.000
&gt;&gt; Yes, we want you to apply everything
that you've learned in the last two

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.780
lessons so far to the Quake Report app.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.360
Instead of using a hardcoded
JSON response, perform an HTTP

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.660
request to a given query URL that we
provide in part of the response and

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.430
display it in the list.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.550
&gt;&gt; So in this quiz,
you're going to right down a plan for

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.680
the list of changes you
need to make to the app.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.900
But no need to make the changes yet.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.210
&gt;&gt; There's no right or wrong answer,

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.430
just write down notes to help you as
you start to think of the problem.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally you know,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.550
if your mind goes blank, don't
worry it happens to the best of us.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.480
&gt;&gt; This is good real world practice
when you're asked to work on

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.710
something you have no
idea where to start.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:15.610
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.110
take the time to resituate yourself in
the context of the QuakeReport app.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.040
Start to imagine what parts of the code
need to be moved around or added.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.290
&gt;&gt; You can refer back to the tsunami and
digifeel sample apps.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.830
&gt;&gt; So think about what the input and

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.810
the outputs to the different
methods would be.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.830
For example,
once we parse the JSON response,

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.370
should the return value still
be a single earthquake?

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.500
What if we want to display
a list of earthquakes?

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.710
&gt;&gt; It's going to be a big coding
task with a lot of steps, but

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.500
I'm confident that you can do it.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally, go get it.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.940
In this quiz, I want you to go and

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.800
plan the changes that you want to
make to the Quake Report app.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.990
Go ahead and plan your steps for

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.100
how you'll modify the Quake Report
app to perform the network request.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.000
Then list your detailed
steps right here.
