00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.770
Here the answers to the quiz,
AsyncTaskLoader

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.990
is a type of Loader that uses
an AsyncTask to do the background work.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.780
There are other types
like Crystal Loader

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.430
which you'll learn about in the next
course when we discuss databases.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.020
Now to create a custom Loader that
searches a list of earthquake object

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.120
we can define an EarthquakeLoader
class which extends from

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.470
AsyncTaskLoader List Earthquake.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.290
The generic type in brackets is
the type of data we want loaded.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.290
As for the last blank,
within the EarthquakeLoader class,

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.320
we need to override
the loadInBackground method,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.600
which will run on the background thread
and then return a list of earthquakes.
