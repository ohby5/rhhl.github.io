00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.270
As you may have started to see in other apps,

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.290
there are plenty of different ways to inform

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.060
the user that there may be a problem with connectivity.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.040
The material design spec offers some guidelines on how to present this type of

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.540
error to the user with an example in the e-mail app and the search app.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.110
In the last coding task of this lesson and of this course,

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.420
we'll introduce logic to check if there is

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.020
network connectivity before we initialize the loader to kick off the request.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.824
Now, if there isn't internet connectivity,

00:00:27.824 --> 00:00:30.150
then we'll change the empty state TextView to show

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.550
a "No internet connection" error message like in this screenshot.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.390
Now, I'm providing you with a link to this developer guide,

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.910
on how to connect to the network and check for connectivity.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.870
Now, one more really important note here at the top of the doc.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.400
You'll also need to declare another permission in

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.930
the AndroidManifest file to access the network state, as you can see here.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.125
So, make sure you add this line to your manifest.

00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:56.770
Once you've completed the first two tasks,

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.260
then test your app to make sure it works with and

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.425
without internet connectivity by using airplane mode again.

00:01:02.425 --> 00:01:05.695
Now, remember to force stop the app in between tests,

00:01:05.695 --> 00:01:08.710
so that the activities destroyed and created again from scratch.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.880
You can do this by swiping the app off the recent list.
