00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.040
All right.
So

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.530
I've imported the project
into Android Studio.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.870
I'm going to go ahead and
Run button here.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.990
I'm going to run this in my emulator so
you can see it.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.385
Boom, right away, we got some red logs.

00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:15.955
Let's go look at the app and
see what happened.

00:00:15.955 --> 00:00:19.796
And indeed, I can see the error
dialogue shows up with the text,

00:00:19.796 --> 00:00:22.585
Unfortunately, Did You Feel It
has stopped.

00:00:22.585 --> 00:00:24.534
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:24.534 --> 00:00:28.405
So let's look for what might have
caused this error to happen.

00:00:28.405 --> 00:00:32.910
By the way, if horizontal scroll bars
drive you crazy as much as they do me,

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.310
you can click on the use soft
wraps button on the left side of

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.560
Android Studio's log panel and
that'll wrap the text around here.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.580
So now all we have to do
is scroll up and look for

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.310
where all this nonsense started, and
here we see Fatal Exception main.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.540
That's nothing to be afraid of.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.042
Did you know that bugs are more
afraid of you than you are of them?

00:00:56.042 --> 00:00:59.876
And indeed here's the likely
candidate right here.

00:00:59.876 --> 00:01:02.400
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.558
You might have to scroll
horizontally to see this but

00:01:05.558 --> 00:01:10.240
it says NetworkOnMainThreadException,
so that's what caused our crash.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.780
So the answer to our quiz should
be NetworkOnMainThreadException.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.270
Okay, so now that we know that
the cause of our crash is

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.730
NetworkOnMainThreadException which
we do about it.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.890
We'll explore the solution to
this problem in the next lesson.
