00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.859
So, that was the last step!

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:03.260
&gt;&gt; Woo hoo, congratulations!

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.650
You're done with the course!

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.730
&gt;&gt; For sure a great work.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.900
&gt;&gt; Those were some really
advanced concepts, and

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.210
you got through all of them.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and quite a lot, I might add,
in a short amount of time.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.740
You learned how to make a network
request to a web server

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.320
using a background thread and then you
learned how to parse the JSON response.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.630
And then last and probably most
important is you've learned to surface

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.461
that data to the user in a pleasing way?

00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:27.407
&gt;&gt; We really hope that you'll continue
building on what you've learned in this

00:00:27.407 --> 00:00:30.269
course by creating other apps
that connect to web APIs.

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.183
&gt;&gt; All right that's a wrap.

00:00:33.183 --> 00:00:35.970
&gt;&gt; Wait, what?

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.659
&gt;&gt; Hey is someone going to let us out?

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:40.365
&gt;&gt; I'm hungry.

00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:42.451
&gt;&gt; Me too.
