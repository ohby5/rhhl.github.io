When there is no Internet connection and
you open up the Quake Report app,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.490
the empty state is visible and
it says, No earthquakes found.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.117
Since we can't communicate
with the USGS web server,

00:00:10.117 --> 00:00:12.126
we can't fetch the list of earthquakes.

00:00:12.126 --> 00:00:15.272
Now the problem with this behavior Is
that the user may think that there

00:00:15.272 --> 00:00:16.565
are no recent earthquakes.

00:00:16.565 --> 00:00:20.225
When actually the real problem is just
that they don't have any Internet

00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:21.645
connectivity.

00:00:21.645 --> 00:00:25.175
So it's actually better to warn
the user of the actual issue, so

00:00:25.175 --> 00:00:28.335
they can actually do something like
double check their Internet connection

00:00:28.335 --> 00:00:30.515
or move to an area where
there's better connectivity.
