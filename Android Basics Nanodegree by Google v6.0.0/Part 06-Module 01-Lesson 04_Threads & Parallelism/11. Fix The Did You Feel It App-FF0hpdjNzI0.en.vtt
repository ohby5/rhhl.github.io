00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.735
We've looked extensively at how
AsyncTask can be used to move

00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:06.770
time-consuming operations
to a background thread, and

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.460
how to get the result back
onto the main thread.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.520
So you must be antsy now.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.830
So now I'd like you to fix
the NetworkOnMainThreadException

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.040
that caused the Did You Feel It
app to crash on start up.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.340
So go ahead and move the networking code
off the main thread using AsyncTask, and

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.670
check this box here when you're done.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.990
Now, we recommend keeping the utility
methods in the utils class and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.210
we use it to house some useful helper
methods shown here in the structure tab.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.960
Also note that these methods
are declared as static, so

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.080
that they can be referenced directly
using the class name without needing

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.660
an actual instance of the utils object.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.780
In the main activity, we can call
the utils.fetchEarthquakeData method

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.120
to make the network request and
parse the response.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.750
When you're done, the app should look
like this screenshot here on the right.
