00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.471
It's a common mistake to only test
the app in the best case use scenarios,

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:07.734
such as in our home or in our office
where we're writing our code and

00:00:07.734 --> 00:00:09.902
we have a really good
Internet connection.

00:00:09.902 --> 00:00:14.424
But as professional Android developers,
it's important to take into account and

00:00:14.424 --> 00:00:17.911
test the worst case or edge case
scenarios in which our app will be

00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:20.123
used and perhaps behave unexpectedly.

00:00:20.123 --> 00:00:23.727
Sometimes this means that our app may be
used in places where there's a spotty

00:00:23.727 --> 00:00:26.610
Internet connection and
that's where a loading indicator,

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.991
such as the one we added in, comes in as
a great way to let the user know that

00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:31.788
we're still working on the request.

00:00:31.788 --> 00:00:34.910
It's also possible that the user
will be in a place with no Internet

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.874
connection at all.

00:00:35.874 --> 00:00:37.594
So what happens then?

00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:42.255
Does the app appear blank or
does it unexpectedly crash?

00:00:42.255 --> 00:00:45.015
Well, building a polished
user experience

00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:47.695
means handling all of these edge cases.

00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:50.538
Now I want you to examine the current
behavior of the quake report app when we

00:00:50.538 --> 00:00:51.724
have no Internet connection.

00:00:51.724 --> 00:00:55.335
We can test this by turning
on Airplane Mode on a device.

00:00:55.335 --> 00:00:58.318
When you go on airplanes,
you usually turn on this mode.

00:00:58.318 --> 00:01:01.959
Airplane Mode disables Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth and cellular connectivity,

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:03.727
meaning the device is now offline.

00:01:03.727 --> 00:01:07.401
Pull down the notification shade and
under the Quick Settings,

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:11.902
turn on Airplane Mode, then you should
see an airplane icon in the status bar.

00:01:11.902 --> 00:01:15.665
If your version of Android looks
different, you can also find this option

00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:19.136
in the Settings app underneath
the section Wireless and Networks.

00:01:19.136 --> 00:01:21.214
See the link below for more help.

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:24.510
Now go ahead and
kill the app using the Resets menu, and

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.030
then start it up from scratch.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.650
When that happens,
what do you see in the app?

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.320
Go ahead and
write your answer in this text box.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.690
When you're done,
browse around other apps and

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.590
check what happens when there
is no Internet connectivity.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.910
If you find any particularly good or
bad examples,

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.390
