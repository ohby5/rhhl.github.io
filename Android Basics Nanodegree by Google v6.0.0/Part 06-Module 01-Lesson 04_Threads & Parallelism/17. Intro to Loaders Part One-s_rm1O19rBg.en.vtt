00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.870
If you needed help, you could have
referenced the loaders developer guide

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.326
which mentions all the components
in the loader API.

00:00:06.326 --> 00:00:08.386
Here are the solutions to the quiz.

00:00:08.386 --> 00:00:11.376
The loader manager interacts with
an activity to manage one or

00:00:11.376 --> 00:00:13.130
more loader instances.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.010
It handles creating and

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.190
destroying loaders as well as
reusing them if necessary.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.009
Now in order for activity to be a client
that interacts with the loader manager,

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.555
we need the earthquake
activity to implement

00:00:25.555 --> 00:00:28.510
the LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks
interface.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.103
As such, the interface contains three
abstract methods that we need to

00:00:33.103 --> 00:00:34.795
override and implement.

00:00:34.795 --> 00:00:39.182
That includes the onCreateLoader()
method to create and return a new loader

00:00:39.182 --> 00:00:43.769
instance, the onLoadFinished() method
that receives the data once the loader

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.489
has finished loading it, and lastly, the
onLoaderReset() method to handle when

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.432
the previously created
loader is no longer needed.

00:00:51.432 --> 00:00:54.090
And thus,
the existing data can be discarded.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.051
Once these callback
methods are implemented,

00:00:56.051 --> 00:00:58.695
we can start a loader when
the activity is launched.

00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:01.575
So in the EarthquakeActivity
onCreate() method,

00:01:01.575 --> 00:01:04.815
we should call
the getLoaderManager.initLoader method,

00:01:04.815 --> 00:01:09.065
passing in 0, null, and of reference to
the current EarthquakeActivity object.
