00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
Sometimes, apps have no data to display.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.465
For example, there may be no new messages in someone's email inbox.

00:00:06.465 --> 00:00:10.095
So as developers, we need to handle this situation gracefully.

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:14.025
Well-designed apps will even try to make the experience a little bit more pleasant,

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:16.245
would say, a cute graphic for example.

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:18.570
Even better, would be to fill the empty space with

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.510
some starter content or advice on how to get started.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.060
This will vary based on what's appropriate for your app.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.005
For now, let's focus on

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:30.865
a very simple empty state that clearly communicates that there were no earthquakes found.

00:00:30.865 --> 00:00:33.430
This is much better than having a blank screen.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.190
Now, you're welcome to expand on this and make the empty state

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.980
more sophisticated in the future but the question

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.740
of whether or not the USGS webserver will ever returns

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.920
zero earthquakes is a different story and in any case,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.150
it's ideal for our app to contain logic to handle the scenario if it ever happens.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.430
Fortunately, the Android framework team

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.010
already expected that this would be a common use case.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.795
So they exposed a way for developers to set an empty view for ListView,

00:00:58.795 --> 00:01:02.065
which will only be displayed whenever there is no data in the list.

00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:04.580
Meaning, the adapters dataset is empty.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.170
In this coding task,

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.990
you're going to implement this behavior in a quick report app.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.290
The first thing you should do is modify the XML layout for

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.010
the earthquake activity to have a ViewGroup that contains two children,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.655
the ListView and a TextView for the EmptyView.

00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:24.695
Now, the EmptyView and the ListView should be siblings within the parent view group.

00:01:24.695 --> 00:01:26.960
Both siblings should overlap and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.495
the ListView should take up the full height and width the screen,

00:01:29.495 --> 00:01:32.375
while the TextView should be centered within the full screen.

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:34.699
Once you've updated the layout, next,

00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:37.500
I want you to modify that an earthquake activity Java class,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.630
so that in the onCreate method you set

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.115
the EmptyView method on the ListView object and pass in the EmptyView.

00:01:44.115 --> 00:01:47.070
Here's the documentation for the setEmptyView method.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.130
What is said, when there are no items in the list,

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.210
the Android framework will hide the ListView and make this EmptyView visible.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.965
If there are items, however,

00:01:55.965 --> 00:01:59.910
the ListView will be made visible and this EmptyView will be hidden.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.630
All these changes in view visibility are automatically handled for you,

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.055
which is pretty sweet.

00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:09.210
One more caveat I want to point out is that when you first launch the app,

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.840
there's no data yet because we haven't finished loading it.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.140
To avoid having the no earthquakes found

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.590
message blink on the screen briefly while the data's being loaded for the first time,

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.915
only assign the text in the empty state TextView after the first load is completed,

00:02:22.915 --> 00:02:25.690
so here in the onload finished method.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.995
Now, can you think of a way to verify that the empty view works?

00:02:28.995 --> 00:02:32.560
Here's a little hint. You'll want to temporarily comment out some code.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.720
Check these boxes when you're done.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.730
Then you can try the bonus challenge.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.740
Do you know of an Android app that tries to make

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.955
the empty state be a pleasant user experience?

00:02:42.955 --> 00:02:47.000
